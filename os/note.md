done: windows can be moved around and positioned by z-index automatically

fix: change how blogs are constructed. 
     code section is single line because the object is a single line. 
     avoid this by maybe pulling from text file or just figuring out multi-line stuff

then: separate out the object content and title bar so scrollbar doesn't overlap
then: figure out how to have multiple has references in URL
then: add all comics
then: lazy loading?

future: latest panel has preview for latest comic page and through-link
future: different window stylings for wiki / blog / comic / news
