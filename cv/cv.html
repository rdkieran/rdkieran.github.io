                    <p>Utilising AI-generated word-level transcriptions of given audio files and the original dialogue script, the python script locates spoken dialogue in each transcript, finds matches within the original dialogue script, extracts matched audio using transcript timestamps, and organises the files into the order of the script.</p>
                    <p>The individual audio files can then be spliced together to produce one continuous audio file consistent with the dialogue script.</p>
