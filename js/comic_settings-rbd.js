//comic_settings.js was created by geno7, with much needed assistance from Dannarchy

//this is the main file you'll be messing with to manage and update your comic. most (not all) of the main toggle-able settings are here.

//comic_archive has more settings pertaining to the archive page, and comic_show has settings pertaining to the main place that pages of your comic are displayed.

let pg = Number(findGetParameter("pg")); //make "pg" mean the current page number (this line doesnt work unless I put it here, if you're inexperienced with js dont worry about it)

////////////////////////
//VARIABLES FOR TWEAKING
////////////////////////

//REALLY IMPORTANT ONES
const maxpg = 3; //the current number of pages your comic has in total. this DOESNT necessarily mean number of IMAGE FILES as it doesn't count pages split into multiple files. 
//YOU MUST UPDATE THIS NUMBER EVERY TIME YOU ADD A NEW PAGE or else it wont display the most recent page

// COMIC PAGE SETTINGS
const folder = "img/comics/rbd"; //directory of the folder where you keep all the comics
const image = "pg"; //what you'll name all your comic pages
const imgPart = "_" //special character(s) you put after the page number to subdivide pages into multiple image files (ie pg2_1, pg2_2, etc)
const ext = "png"; //file extension of your comic pages

//THUMBNAIL SETTINGS
const thumbFolder = "img/thumbs" //directory of the folder where you keep all the thumbnail images for the comics, in case you want the archive page to use thumbnails.
const thumbExt = "png" //file extension of thumbnails
const thumbDefault = "default" //name of the default thumbnail that displays when no thumbnail is set, located in the directory you set thumbFolder to.

//NAVIGATION SETTINGS
const navText = ["First","Previous","Next","Last"]; //alt text for your nav images, or just the text that shows up if you're not using images
const navFolder = "img/comicnav"; //directory where nav images are stored
const navExt = "png" //file extension of nav images
const navScrollTo = "#showComic"; //id of the div you want the page to automatically scroll to when you click to the next comic. will turn off if you delete text between quotation marks

if (pg == 0) {pg = 1;} //display MOST RECENT COMIC when the webpage is loaded. if you want to instead have the FIRST COMIC displayed first, change maxpg to 1.

//pgData holds all the parameters for each of your pages. copypaste this and fill out accordingly:
/*
