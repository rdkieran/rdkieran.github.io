            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm Robbie. I make comics and I do a little bit of coding. As much as you see here in this website.</p>
            <p>I want a website that has space for my comics and a development/hobby blog. I have several comic series all connected in one <span class="title-reference">Star Trek</span>-like universe that each need readers and writeups, and I have a number of coding projects that also need writeups.<br>I'd also like to have some personal blogs for reflective writing.</p>
            <p>The first step will be to get some basic content in the HTML and then some basic styling, followed by working out JavaScript templates for blogs and comics.</p>
            <p>This may take a while.</p>
