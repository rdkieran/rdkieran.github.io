<body>
    <p>The Zird Dimension is the dimension of Zird, the extra-dimensional god. Many people have witnessed terrifying things, appearances if angels and gore beasts from another dimension.</p>
<p><a href="The Scab.html">The Scab</a> is the rotted edge of the 2D world where a 3D cat scratched it, but don't tell them that. They believe it was the Devil herself who made the tear in space and crawled inside, but they'd feel silly saying the texts told of a cat. That enormous cat is still out there in the void of space, confused.</p>
<p>Dimensions in Space Story are <a href="Medium.html">Mediums</a>. Some species have better eyes and insight into the nature of their reality. <a href="Seer.html">Seers</a> can watch reality nonlinearly. They can view inside minds and sneak a peak at the future. <a href="Snerson.html">Sneeple</a> can see outlines. The Zird Dimension is the realm of 3D entities. Some may ascend to the third dimension, most think it's just a myth believed by the 3D'rs.</p>
<h2>Believers of Zird</h2>
<p>Religion based on the belief of higher dimensions. There are many believers. Many claim to have had experiences where they saw a cross section of some kind of entity appear in their 2-Dimensional world. They believe that they're ghosts, demons, or some kind of extra-dimensional creature, if you're an insane person.</p>
<h2>3D'rs</h2>
<p>Entities from the third dimension. They look down on the 2-dimensional world and are confused by it's ability to depict 3D spaces while never utilising a true visual third dimension. It is terrifying. They live in a world with no rational perspective! It is maddening! But every now and then someone will poke the 2D world with a finger and someone in the 2D world has an extra-dimensional experience. Some horrible nearly presented gore flashing in front of them as a physical mass travelling through their dimension.</p>
<p>Scary for everyone, actually.</p>
