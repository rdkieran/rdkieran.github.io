<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Full name: The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets (aka The Federation, the GFOCP, or The Fops) are a <a href="Galactic Political Clique.html">Galactic Political Clique</a> founded by the <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a>. They are the second oldest GPC after <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Member Species: <a href="Armado.html">Armado</a>, <a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a>, <a href="Coil.html">Coil</a>, <a href="Human.html">Human</a>, <a href="Roundoid.html">Roundoid</a>, <a href="Snerson.html">Snerson</a>, <a href="Triple.html">Triple</a>, and <a href="Troll.html">Troll</a>.</p>
<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The origins of the Federation go back to before space flight, in the industrial ages of its member planets. As soon as planets could send messages into space, they were talking to one another. This communication network was called <a href="SpaceNet.html">SpaceNet</a>, and the species of the Federation spoke to one another across space for hundreds of years before their eventual meeting on <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">The Woods#Too Big</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a>, with the pivotal help of the <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a>, were the first to achieve long distance space travel, and founded the Federation capital on the <a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> planet <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">The Woods#Too Big</a> in <a href="The Woods.html">The Woods</a>.</p>
<h1>Major Events</h1>
<h2>The Humiliation</h2>
<h2>The Dabbling</h2>
<p><a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a> humbled The Federation when they were forced to cease an invasion against <a href="Elf.html">The Elves</a> by superior might and public outcry. Since then, there's been a stink in the air about upper leadership. </p>
<h2>Erosion</h2>
<p>The Galactic Federation of Planets became The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets after the Dabbling. <a href="Max Velocity.html">Max Velocity</a>, <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> war hero and all around fun times guy, had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's super sad what happened out there folks. I know, I was there. And no, I'm not proud of it, and I'm proud that I'm not, because that makes me humble. And humility is the name of the game out there, folks. </p>
<p>You don't know it 'til you've seen it. How small and humble we are in the face of the universe. It's beautiful, really. This is what you're missing by not being out with us, out there in the stars. But I didn't come here today to say that. Just shooting from the hip. But think about it. Okay.</p>
<p>We are a Federation bound to our ideals. Sometimes that means pushing the envelope, but can you blame us? Nothing ever got done without a little risk involved. Haven't we all at one time or another, got caught with our hand in the cookie jar? Do you know that expression. Those human movies they have. No? Nevermind.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is... I don't know what. But what can you say, really, in the face of the universe? It's terrible what happened It won't happen again. That's a Federation promise! No more invading. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rousing speech was given the day the Elven Quarter was opened on <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">The Woods#Too Big</a>. The Elves mainly refuse to use this gifted colony, although some recognise the benefits of Federation society and opt to stay there, while relations between The Federation and The Conspiracy continue to coast along without incident, while they engage in their secret culture war. </p>
<p>The Federation continues to beckon the Elf population to the side of guaranteed housing and self-sufficiency with no social mobility, while the The Conspiracy works the fringes of Federation space with the allure of <a href="Money.html">Money</a>, and its power over people.</p>
