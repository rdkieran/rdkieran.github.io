<h2>Description</h2>
<h2>List of Humans</h2>
<p>The Humiliation of Humans are a member species of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> with no official homeworld.</p>
<h2>Earth, Mars, and so on</h2>
<p>Some hundreds of years ago, they nuked the holy bejeezus out of the home planet of Earth, and then they also nuked the holy bejeezus out of their backup planet of <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a>.</p>
<p>The period of decline, destruction, and dispersal of the human race is known as <a href="The Humiliation.html">The Humiliation</a>. It's a bit mean, really.</p>
<p>They GFOCP would typically respond to cataclysmic events like this by terraforming a planet as a gift, but it was decided that it would be unwise to give the humans a third planet to destroy.</p>
<p>And so humans find themselves a nomadic people, scattered across space. It's said they can be found in groups in every populated system in the universe. Their invasive curiosity infects the universe.</p>
<h2>Mean Spirited Little Creatures</h2>
<p>Humans are a very lonely species. They lived too far away from all the wonders of the universe to enjoy them, and were purposefully excluded for hundreds of years. <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a> could have helped, humans could have been in the Federation in the 1800s. But following their investigations into human culture decided, they weren't worth the risk. Mean spirited little creatures.</p>
<p>It's hard to deny the reputation of humans when they made the movies themselves. Human movies quickly spread in the culture-starved Federation, which hadn't invited a new member species in decades. The movies linger on a lot of the negative aspects of human culture, and so it hasn't made the best impression on the rest of the galaxy.</p>
<p>It's hard for aliens to understand. They're from the majority part of space where it's bustling with life on every other planet. This was a fact that was obscured by Federation technology to keep Humans from getting too excited about going to space. Humans thought for years that they were alone in the universe, limited for too long to their lonely corner of the galaxy.</p>
<h2>Uplifted Animals</h2>
<p><a href="Animal.html">Animal</a> are considered to be a sub-species of Human, being something like a genetically engineered parallel. After the humans were initially refused Federation membership, they got really lonely, and decided that if the aliens wouldn't have them, they could make aliens of their own. Humans still continue to create uplifted animals. It's something the Federation should really address at some point.</p>
