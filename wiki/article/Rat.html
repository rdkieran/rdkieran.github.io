<h2>Description</h2>
<h2>List of Rats</h2>
<p>The <em>Riddle of Rats</em> are a member species of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>, <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, <a href="The Bloody Consortium.html">The Bloody Consortium</a>, <a href="The Cool Planets Club.html">The Cool Planets Club</a>, and <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Rats are everywhere. From what I've witnessed, they always have been. Little rats that scurry around, big rats that gnaw on mountains, 5th-Dimensional rats who hassle 4th-Dimensional cats. Not all of them can speak, but all of them can squeak. I've seen it.</p>
<h2>Origin Theories</h2>
<p><a href="Human.html">Humans</a>, <a href="Bozo.html">Bozos</a>, <a href="Coil.html">Coils</a>, <a href="Elf.html">Elves</a>, everyone. They've all known about rats long before they joined them in exploring the stars. Rats have lived alongside all species in the universe, as pests, pets, predators, and pals. Their omnipresence is almost unsettling, and different cultures have their own theories on this.</p>
<h3>Rats are God</h3>
<p>The theory goes like this. Rats are great. Everybody has them because they're just the optimal creature. There's something about them, whatever shape they take, that evolution just likes. They're perfect, and surely they are the true image of God.</p>
<p>Most people who like this theory stop short at the God part. Space has so many mysteries that you could create a religion out of, and of those mysteries the rat one is a little weak.</p>
<h3>Cosmic Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Some people who insist on rats being a pest species believe that they were somehow incepted by a higher being with sinister motives. Some cross over with the God theory and believe that they were a gift, but most people who go with the inception theory think that they're up to something.</p>
<p>Nobody says <em>what</em> they or their creator might be up to. Just something.</p>
<h3>Lab Rats</h3>
<p>Xenobiologists suggest that there's a trend in rat evolution across the universe that suggests they may have been introduced in a certain order to different worlds, by some kind of bioengineering species. Subtle differences in rats on neighbouring planets suggest a pattern of iteration. </p>
<p>Some more whimsical xenobiologists believe that if we could follow the trail of rats through space, we could eventually catch up to this engineering species. Books on this theory litter the shelves of every xenobiology bookshop in the universe. Frankly, people are sick of it.</p>
<h3>We're Just Rat People, Stop Being Weird</h3>
<p>This is the common stance by the rat population. The <em>Riddle of Rats</em> consider themselves to be one species and one community, despite their differences. Frankly, they find the insistence on explaining these differences to be insulting, and annoying.</p>
