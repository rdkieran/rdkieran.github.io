    <p>Elves are the founders of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, banded together as one people after their attempted forced assimilation into <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a>.</p>
<p>They come in many shapes and sizes, but as a rule, they always have big hands, and some kind of mystical abilities.</p>
<p>There are two main subspecies of Elf: Posh Elf and War Elf, and a third subspecies hunted to obscurity, the Yoga Elves. Of the three, the Posh Elves are the weakest in power, the War Elves are the weakest in will, and the Yoga Elves are the strongest in both, which the other two don't appreciate.</p>
<h2>Posh Elf</h2>
<p>Posh Elves, or <em>Poshos</em>, are the leader class of Elves. They are tall, dark haired, point-eared people with long, sharp fingers that form spade-like wedges on the end of their spindly arms.</p>
<p>They seem to float as they walk, and find a way to look down on everyone, even when they're lying on their back.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>Posh Elves have some mystical ability to see into the minds of others and extract information. They do this through physical contact with the head, accessing memories, thoughts, and feelings.</p>

<h2>War Elf</h2>
<p>War Elves, aka Dwarves, are a more physically tough variant of Elf, with backgrounds in mining and technological knowledge.</p>
<p>They are big, square things with coarse black hair and heavy armoured suits. Many of them wear visors that subdue their latent psychic powers.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>War Elves fear their powers, and have built their culture around their suppression. They are less compassionate, less emotionally vulnerable, for fear of the volatility of their psychic abilities.</p>
<p>Their visors suppress their powers, but without them, their powers would be dangerous to themselves and others. Their mental link to others is challenging to control, melding minds with others in a way that becomes difficult to untangle. Only Yoga Elves are capable of untangling themselves from the mind of a War Elf.</p>
<p>It's like a kind of reckless empathy that's uncomfortable to be stuck in, and difficult to escape. Except it does psychic damage. </p>
<p>Poshos look down on them for their lack of control over their abilities.</p>
<h2>Yoga Elf</h2>
<p>They have the same dark hair, pointy ears, and shovel-like hands, but tend to be short compared to the average Posh Elf. However, this makes little difference overall, and they can pass by unnoticed among other Posh Elves.</p>
<p>Because of their more potent abilities, Yoga Elves have been feared, hunted, and exiled by Posh Elf society for many years. As a result, they have a greater affinity for other species, which serves to reinforce the Posh Elves' latent xenophobia.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>Yoga Elves share the Posh Elves' powers, but their abilities go beyond simply reading minds, but writing and rewriting them, and extracting the inner worlds of others into the physical realm.</p>
<p>This means that they can see and restructure someone's identity through mind manipulation in the case of the War Elf <a href="Ixtal.html">Ixtal</a>, or extract past selves from someone's past and give them a physical form, as happened to <a href="Squeakella.html">Squeakella</a>.</p>
