<h1>Frayja</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>A <a href="Thread.html">Thread</a> from <a href="The Spool.html">The Spool</a>. Daughter of <a href="Bobbin.html">Bobbin</a> and sister of <a href="Sewella.html">Sewella</a> <a href="Ty.html">Ty</a>, and <a href="Fred.html">Fred</a></p>

There, she researched regenerative biology using her own biology and the research of Ihava Fullbody, who was only an arm when they met.</p>
<h1>Evil Frayja</h1>
<p><a href="Siana.html">Siana</a> created Evil Frayja to keep a genetic sample of Frayja close to hand in case it was ever needed. She is manipulated to be evil. Frayja, and all Threads, are easily manipulated, as their personalities are formed based on the clothes they wear. Evil Frayja got a monocle when she was born, which influenced her greatly.
