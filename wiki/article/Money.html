    <p>Money (~~M~~) is currency. Big ones. It's what all the new Galactic Unions want. It's used by <a href="The Bloody Consortium.html">The Bloody Consortium</a>, <a href="The Cool Planets Club.html">The Cool Planets Club</a>, and <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. </p>
<p><a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a> have their own currency, and <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> does not use currency at all.</p>
<h2>The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</h2>
<h3>~~M~~ is Good! / ~~M~~ is Bad!</h3>
<p>The Federation is an optimised communist society. It's perfect if that's all you want: an education, a house, a job, and nice places to spend time with people you love.</p>
<p>However, you have autonomy in this society, and you might want more than that. A private ship to take you to the pleasure planet without having to share a carriage with other people.</p>
<p>These things exist, but they cannot be bought. You get them through favours and trades. This means that the Federation operates on social currency, and the way to build social currency is to scramble for positions of power within organisations like The Federation.</p>
<p>However, the Federation was made by <a href="Bozo.html">The Bozo</a>. They got in on the ground floor and populated all the best jobs and best positions, and passed them onto their friends and family. Idealistic as ever, they don't really see the issue. They got there first, why should they give up their seat?</p>
<h3>Pimp My Federation</h3>
<p>So what do you do to afford a life more comfortable than the average Federation citizen? Do you get a job in The Federation? Impress enough people in the Federation that they maybe give you a nice room, or some Colonists offer you a plot of land to bring your skills to their planet. It might happen, but there aren't many positions that will get you there. And most of the people in those jobs are Bozo anyway.</p>
<p>This problem may have been around for a while. The Federation was slowing down. After hundreds of years of expansion into space, they hit an obstacle they couldn't absorb for their own growth: <a href="Elf.html">The Elves</a>. It was a brick wall. For the first time, something was in the way that The Federation, or more rightly The Bozo, couldn't overcome. The Elves refused to join and, refused to interact.</p>
<p>This frustration lead to <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a> which, while it ended in defeat for The Federation, succeeded in entangling their societies. Elves moved to Federation planets, and began to absorb the socialist ideals of The Federation. But equally, The Elves answered with their own influence: </p>
<h3>~~M~~oney Talks</h3>

<p>Shops opening up in fringe facilities, people getting a hold of the currency, and realising that it is power given physical form. People will do things for it, they will give you things for it. They'll do jobs no one wants to do, give you extravagant things that aren't yours. </p>
<p>The Federation doesn't have anything like this. You can't pick IOUs off of the street and cash them in for goods and services. You can't trade in personal favours with people who don't know one another.</p>
<p>But goodwill also doesn't run out as long as it goes back and forth forever. The same is not true for ~~M~~oney. Eventually it ends up in the pocket of someone playing the game. It's a game of tricks and deceit. The game of social graces and kindness in exchange for gestures of goodwill is a better game, but you can't profit from it. You <em>can</em> profit from ~~M~~oney, though.</p>
<p>And in a world where goodwill and kindness doesn't earn you anything because the people at the top don't intend to move? Then maybe the game of kindness isn't going to pay off. You stand a better chance investing in ~~M~~oney over goodwill. You can rely on it better, right?</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people think this, and you can't blame them if the kindness and goodwill game isn't giving them what they need to live the life they see the Bozos enjoy as the perks of their often unearned social standing. Capitalism thrives in a culture of inequality, where everyone is desperate to have some say in their share of the pie. For fear of one day going hungry, living a life that's beneath anyone's standards.</p>
<p>~~M~~oney is accepted on the more metropolitan worlds, and on the many space stations that mark the trade routes between worlds. It's here, we have it now, and people are starting to catch onto what it can do for them.</p>
