<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies are a <a href="Galactic Political Clique.html">Galactic Political Clique</a> founded by divine intervention. They are the oldest known GPC, and only accept the term to be polite. They are also lesser players in the political intrigue of higher realms, somewhere where the higher ranks of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a> are hard at work. </p>
<p>All designs begun in this universe are the games of some middle managers from a higher dimension.</p>
<p>They are generally amicable and resist war. They're all-powerful, and if anyone has tried to take them on, there is no history of it.</p>
<p>Of the species and beings who are members of the Dominion, the <a href="Seer.html">Seer</a> are the most prominent in <a href="Federation Space.html">Federation Space</a>, acting as psychics for <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>. </p>
<p>There are also some <a href="Rat.html">Rat</a> species who find themselves included in the Clique. Those with ascended qualities like telekinetic and psychic abilities similar to Seers and <a href="Elf.html">Elves</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Elf.html">Elves</a> don't count themselves as part of the Dominion, although the Dominion would happily have them. The Elves are an old species, about which little is known. They resist involvement in Cliques for unknown reasons. It seems like they might just prefer to work on their own internal politics, although they do ally with some <a href="Rat.html">Rat</a> species and <a href="Troll.html">Trolls</a>, who have shared their region of space for long enough to be similar culturally.</p>
<p>Their direct messengers are the <a href="Seer.html">Seer</a> people, who have direct line with the <a href="Besties.html">Besties</a>; the leading pantheon of the Dominion who relate messages from the Gods.</p>
