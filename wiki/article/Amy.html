<h1>Amy</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>Amy is a <a href="Human.html">Human</a>, serving <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> as a communications officer on board the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>She has served under <a href="Captain.html">Captain</a> for several years, enjoying the highs and lows of the space mystery life. She is deadly with a rifle, with a quick temper when threatened. </p>
<p>On an away mission in the mines of <a href="Rainbow Deathspiral#Redworld IV.html">Redworld IV</a>, she was imprisoned by <a href="Clippers.html">Clippers</a>. While in a mental prison, she lucid dreamed herself aboard the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a> where she killed seven of her fellow Crewmates in a confused rage before she was released from captivity. Ever since, she's been quick to defend herself, and unsure of her reality.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>She was born on <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a>, in the slums of capital colony <a href="Mars#New Wick.html">Mars#New Wick</a>. She won a scholarship to study at <a href="Institute for Finding Things Out.html">Institute for Finding Things Out</a>, where she was the only human in her year. She became friends with a <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> called <a href="Jockey.html">Jockey</a>, who was himself the only of his species that year.</p>
<p>Her first post following her graduation was at a communications outpost in deep space, facing <a href="The Void.html">The Void</a>, where she worked with <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> transmissions engineer <a href="Dorbobbie Dumbo.html">Dorbobbie Dumbo</a>.</p>
<p>They worked together in absolute silence for a year, monitoring signals from deep space, searching for signs of communication. One day, Amy received a signal. When she accidentally spoke aloud in excitement, she was quickly sent back to <a href="Federation Space.html">Federation Space</a> for reassignment. </p>
<p>The outpost was subsequently quietly dismantled and quietly moved several thousands miles away, to avoid lingering noise pollution from her raised whisper, reverberating in space.</p>
<p>She still puzzles over the content of the message she received, which unfortunately left no trace on the system. She is unsure whether she saw it at all. She is haunted by it.</p>
