<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Elven Conspiracy is a recently-formed <a href="Galactic Political Clique.html">Galactic Political Clique</a> arranged by <a href="Elf.html">The Elves</a>, also involving <a href="Rat.html">the Rats</a> and <a href="Troll.html">the Trolls</a>. </p>
<h2>It's a bit on the nose, isn't it?</h2>
<p>Wanting to differentiate themselves from the other Galactic Unions with a unique collective noun, and not knowing the implications of the word <em>Conspiracy</em>, they unwittingly made themselves look incredibly suspicious. </p>
<p>Although it <em>is</em> true that they are underhanded, shady, and conniving, that's not unique to them. At least <em>The Conspiracy</em>, as it's often called, isn't corrupt.</p>
<p>An effect of having a name which inspires distrust is that, in order to do all the dodgy things that all governments end up doing, you have to be a bit more clever than that.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p><a href="Elf.html">The Elves</a> were an independent species group, tucked in their private corner of space, mulling over their cosmic secrets.</p>
<p>As they ventured into space, they found a sinister force at work in their galaxy; <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>. The GFOP, recognising the powers of the Elves, tried to bring them into their Federation, but the Elves refused. This lead to <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>, a war to subjugate the Elves and bring them under control.</p>
<p>The Federation had never met an intelligent species that didn't want to join their club, or at least be friends. And this species was cool. Really cool. They had something like Magic. The Federation wanted it, and decided to Dabble. Dabble in a little bit of war and colonisation.</p>
<p>But it failed, and The Federation was forced to stand down their force. In their failure, they adapted their name to The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets, to ensure this sort of thing didn't happen again.</p>
<p>The Elves, as a result, formed a counter Clique to push back against The Federation and further outside influence. The Elven Conspiracy was formed. <a href="Rat.html">The Rats</a> and <a href="Troll.html">The Trolls</a> joined, as they had long trade relations with the Elves in some colonies of their galaxy-wide societies.</p>
<h2>The House of Lords</h2>
<p>The House of Lords are the old collection of families that have headed Elven society in their realm of space for thousands of years. Until recently they have been happy to occupy their space in privacy, and grow old and strange in that privacy.</p>
<p>It started democratically. Elves fought for influence over their society, and some of them did better than others. The rewards of those victories trickled down into their immediate families as education and material wealth. As the rewards built at their feet, their descendants climbed higher and higher in society.</p>
<p>They ran for office off the backs of their wealth and education. They took over the home planets of the Elves and fought for land. Those who fought best won the most, and these families grew as the wealth piled up, shared from one to the next to the next.</p>
<p>At one time, an Elf of no background might spring up from the peasantry, take a political seat, and reap the benefits of that position. Then they would pass it down to their children, and those children simply became part of the system those upstart Elves had sought to overthrow.</p>
<p>Over the years, this developed into a deeply entrenched class system, where by birthright some Elves saw it as their divine right to rule. They learned the ways of ruling, studied and perfected them, and taught them to their children. The ways of wealth and ownership and leadership and political conquest.</p>
<p>The race to the top of the chain continued for centuries, until the social ladder became unscalable for anyone on the lower rungs of society. All that remained to maintain social position was to kick down and keep your own place.</p>
<p>The descendants of those early conquerors and entrepreneurs became wealthy and powerful Lords, with family history in ruling that stretched out longer than any history in industry or craft. They were the ruling class, and as the centuries and millennia marched on, their families grew into houses, and those houses found new worlds to conquer. They build grand cities that became old cities. Mega structures built on layers of old settlements built on barren worlds transformed by terraforming technologies. Impossibly old.</p>
<p>The leadership of overall Elven society was once democratically elected, but eventually the leadership was simply passed between the descendants of each ruling house, as they moved in and out of favour. They all knew one another, and they all scrapped with each other in their political playground, vying for power for the good of their house. </p>
<p>Once the Three Houses had been established and pulled ahead of the rest in their power and influence, leadership essentially passed between the three. Different internal branches of each house may have taken the lead at different times, but it all moved within the The Houses.</p>
<h2>The Three Houses</h2>
<p>The ruling classes of Elven society are mainly comprised of <a href="Elf#Posh Elf.html">Posh Elves</a>, with the places in each house for <a href="Elf#War Elf.html">War Elves</a>, and sometimes <a href="Elf#Yoga Elf.html">Yoga Elves</a>, although this is rare and seen as particularly bad practice. These Elves have big hands, and it's generally sought after that an Elf of high regard has big hands. The bigger the hands, the more secrets you can hold in your fist, as they say.</p>
<p>The Three Houses are House Cuil, House Lalaith, and House Mel, Houses that fashion themselves after The Three Spirits; Life, Laughter, and Love. Despite simply being long-standing political families, they have adopted a sort of Godly status in Elven society. The leaders of each House have powers beyond that of regular Elves, and are known to have communed with entities from other realms and realities. Whether this is just a result of wealth and technology over thousands of years, it doesn't matter so much anymore. They have their Godlike power now, and nobody can take them down through politics alone.</p>
<h3>Live</h3>
<p>House Cuil is the house of Life. They have always desired freedom of body and spirit. However, their desire is selfish. They believe in the freedom of the individual despite what that freedom entails for others. Freedom to conquer and enslave, freedom to seek wealth and power at the expense of others. They are hoarders, warmongers, jealous and unreasonable. They are often undone by infighting, as their ideals of individuality are at odds with the strength they have only because of their family bonds.</p>
<p>House Cuil is therefore a smaller house, but nonetheless powerful. The individual conquests of it's members gives them great influence, but infighting means that their ranks don't grow to the same scale as the other houses.</p>
<h3>Laugh</h3>
<p>House Lalaith is the house of Laughter. They believe in the benefits of camaraderie, and growth through healthy competition. They're not necessarily kind to one another, however. They want above all else to have the last laugh. Whether a laugh is shared or at the expense of another doesn't necessarily matter. </p>
<p>They are good humoured, but are vengeful against those who laugh at their expense. A non-mutual laugh is an insult to those who follow House Lalaith, and so they are encouraged to be candid, open, and keep no secrets from one another. Everyone must be in on the joke, or conflicts will inevitably arise. As such, they are very honourable within their own house</p>
<h3>Love</h3>
<p>House Mel is the house of Love. They are much more socially democratic, allowing for upward mobility in their ranks, and extending offers of power and influence to commonfolk from time to time. Commonfolk on planets with the influence of House Mel enjoy greater community bonds through their whole society. The division in class is not so stark, with high-ranking members of the house comfortably walking in the cities among the people. Social enterprises patch up gaps in government funding, and there is a great deal of trust.</p>
<p>The leaders of house Mel have historically believed in the importance of maintaining the promise of social mobility as a method of fostering trust in their society. Everyone trusts one another more, and extends kindness where they can, believing that the system will reward their generosity in some way.</p>
<p>House Mel is not ideal however, the appearance of social mobility is gatekept as to stagger the progress of anyone who attempts to climb the social ladder. </p>
<p>The highest stations in their society are still populated by old families. Even with their society working nicely, these old families can't truly trust their society to uphold their ancient ideals. And so they cling to power. They call it Love for their society when they weed out Elves who want to increase their share of power too quickly, and are suspicious of social climbers. </p>
<p>As they see it, social mobility is important for the health of their society, but must be made slowly over generations, or else they run the risk of allowing high-level influence from those who haven't been moulded by the establishment over generations of exposure to the higher-class social structure.</p>
<p>They are welcoming to Yoga Elves, where the other two houses shun and fear them. They work with War Elves as equals, appreciating their expertise in war, and respecting their mental boundaries.</p>
<h2>Class, War & Infighting</h2>
<p>Elven society operates on many metasocial layers. On the top level there are the immortals, those that walk with the forces of nature using their genetic and technological enhancements. Their manners are impossibly complex. They don't even know about the wars with or on their planet. They are the leaders of their houses, looking for new ground in higher dimensions to get the upper hand on one another.</p>
<p>Lower in society, deep beneath the most powerful people in their society, there are kings and prime ministers and lords. Schemers seeking to be the best within their current class, hoping to advance into the next rung of society. Maybe one day their children will meet the people and have the influence necessary to have even a scrap of the genetic enhancements the real Gods of their society have. Maybe they will be immortal.</p>
<p>But they're not, for now. They live like the rest of civilised life in the Federation.</p>
<p>And below them still are the lesser Elves; Goblins and Orcs who inhabit spaces with even lower forms of technology. Elves have somehow managed to segregate their entire society from neanderthals to Gods. They are all one species, but they are billions of years apart.</p>
<p>The Kings think nothing of the infighting of the clans, as the Gods feel nothing for the squabbles in 5th dimensional space, and the hypersphere Elves don't think much of the Kings.</p>

<h2>Class</h2>
<p>Honorifics: <a href="Sir.html">Sir</a></p>
<p>Within each house there are tiers of society all the way down to the mudrunners and the golems and the war elves and the posh elves and the wildcards like the yoga elves. There's more kinds of elf than there are species in the federation. They are the single most dominant species in terms of population when tracing common genetic heritage, but they're isolated to their own small region of space.</p>
<p>Every possible mutation and adaptation has been made. The cave elves, the iron working elves, the fighting elves, the psychic elves, the posh elves, the humble elves, every single kind of niche you can think of, there's an elf for it, and they all have impressions of all the others that determine how they interact. The layers of manners and sociopolitical tact is infinite.</p>
<p>Any elf will ask first the class and house of another elf, if it's not clear from their physiology. They come in every race, like humans.</p>
