    <p>I-Me's are a brand of personal <a href="Robot.html">Robot</a> produced by families associated within the <a href="The Elven Conspiracy#Laugh.html">House Lalaith</a>. They're used to pick up sticks and whatever else you need robots to do. Mostly they just interrupt.</p>
<p>They were marketed to <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> to automate work previously undergone by <a href="Beeple.html">Beeple</a>, but with a controlled, private hivemind. The Beeple are annoyed by this.</p>
<h2>Artists Will Kill Us All</h2>
<p>Reference fir writing:<br />
- AI technology making people dumb or something. <br />
- Reminds me of that talk a few years ago about robots. My takeaway from that was that robots will kill us if they're designed badly by well-meaning artists.<br />
- And poor regulations on androids could result in some kind of fleet of technically buggy, evil androids. I-ME may be one of these poorly regulated androids, provided by the Elves, with their advanced technology they sell on the fringes of Federation Space.</p>
