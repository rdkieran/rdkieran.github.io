<h1>Vod</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>Vod is a <a href="Thing.html">Thing</a> of some sort, serving as first commander of the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>He was created by <a href="Teddie.html">Teddie</a> as a <a href="Hologram.html">Hologram</a> before attaining sentience during an incident in <a href="Photonic Space.html">Photonic Space</a>. Since then he has been a non-specific biological entity with full autonomy as a member of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">the Federation</a>. He has a romantic relationship with <a href="Bill.html">Bill</a>.</p>
<h2>The Vampire of Vinceprice Manor </h2>
<p>Vod was the Vampire of <a href="Westerfield#Vinceprice Manor.html">Vinceprice Manor</a> on the outskirts of <a href="Westerfield.html">Westerfield</a>. He wiled away his days planning out schemes to lure the townsfolk into his thrall. His greatest nemesis was <a href="Admiral Dog.html">Dan Doggett</a>, a marshal of Westerfield and then-first commander of the Voyeur.</p>
<h2>Photonic Space</h2>
<p>During an expedition into <a href="Photonic Space.html">Photonic Space</a>, Photonic beings, unfamiliar with the ship and it's technology, attempted to resolve the conflict between the Holodeck on board the ship and the physical ship itself. </p>
<p>Believing the ship to be an anomaly attached to a normal photonic world, they began trying to convert every being on board into Photonics. <a href="Edosi.html">Edosi</a> pushed back until they realised their error and the Voyeur and the Photonics agreed to part ways. The Photonics converted all crew members back and the Voyeur left Photonic Space.</p>
<p>However, during all of this, the Vampire of Vinceprice Manor was in battle with Dan Doggett. As the Photonics took notice of the ship and began their conversion, their battle was interrupted by visiting Photonics. The Vampire, seizing the opportunity, attempted to enthrall them. This provoked matters, and so Dan Doggett joined with the Photonics to keep the Vampire at bay while the divide between their worlds was thin.</p>
<p>They held him off and eventually subdued him in his manor where they locked him away until the event concluded.</p>
<h2>Bloodthirsty Murderer</h2>
<p>Westerfield was at peace, and the barrier between holograms and biologics was solid again. </p>
<p>Each time the Vampire is subdued in his coffin, he takes some time to regenerate, until the coffin is opened again, and he is prompted to rise from his slumber. Life goes on.</p>
<p>In the night, he rose to weave his schemes. He descended into the village to feast.</p>
<p>In the morning, Commander Dog donned his vampire hunting gear and made his way to Westerfield. The atmosphere was different. At the scene of the crime, the ferrous stench of blood was sharper, and the corpses of the villagers had aged differently. More gruesome. The sense of realism was too much. He scanned the blood. Real. He checked the holomatrix for records of these entities. No records. Finally he called the doctor. They were biological, and now they're dead. The Vampire had killed them.</p>
<p>Holograms cannot kill people. There are too many safeguards. Checks on their systems confirmed the suspicion: the Photonics hadn't stopped at correcting their conversions; they had turned the Holograms biological too.</p>
<p>The Vampire sat on his high seat in his manor, picking his teeth. Bones lay at his feet and the air was dark.</p>
<p>In a final confrontation with Dan Doggett, Commander Dog, the Vampire was subdued and taken into custody for further study.</p>
<p><a href="Captain.html">Captain</a> and <a href="Admiral Dog.html">Commander Dog</a> argued over what to do with him. With assistance from <a href="Bill.html">Bill</a> the <a href="Seer.html">Seer</a>, the Vampire was reformed, and Captain allowed him a place in the crew. Dog disagreed with this wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>The holodeck was closed off, and the holographic villagers regenerated from backups. No one has to know.</p>
<h2>One of the Family</h2>
<p>He chose the name Vod and became an Ensign, quickly proving that the thousands of years of life experience he had automatically generated as a hologram were useful as an officer. His origins were hidden from most of the crew, and from the Federation. </p>
<p>If anyone asks, this is what happened.</p>
<p>He was a hologram who became sentient. He was turned biological soon after and recognised the error of his ways. He does a good job and everyone likes him.</p>
<p>The incident and the cover up that followed was a major factor in the departure of Dog from the Voyeur, as well as some other revelations.</p>
<p>Vod rose to take over Dog's role as first commander, which he holds until the present day.</p>
