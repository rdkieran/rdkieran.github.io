<body>
    <p>Laelithar is a <a href="Elf#Posh Elf.html">Posh Elf</a>, assigned to <a href="The Collective.html">The Collective</a> as an overseer on behalf of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. He reports to his <a href="Sir.html">Sir</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the departure of Hayley, Laelithar was assigned to keep the Collective project from falling apart due to management conflicts. Under his supervision, the project enlisted help from across the universe, a broad range of species to bolster their ranks and diversify the genetic reference material. </p>
<p>As the work of the Collective has developed, he has become less careful in his treatment of its researchers, more likely to show his true distaste for them.</p>
<h2>The Collective</h2>
<p><a href="The Collective.html">The Collective</a> is funded by Laelithar's <a href="Sir.html">Sir</a>. Laelithar is, secretly, the son of his Sir. Where some members of the cast may assume that this is a high level play by <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, it is in fact just a small-time scheme by petty Kings to scratch together petty influence. </p>
<p>Laelithar will one day take over his dad's job, and his daughter will have his job when he moves on, ever pressing forward for better social standing in their impossibly dense society. This is their latest plot. A species that evolves by consuming the parts of other species. If they can supercharge their evolution, maybe their family can advance in Elven society faster. Genetic engineering and cloning and immortality and omnipotence are all part of higher Elven society, but they would never let that trickle down to someone as low as Laelithar and his family.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like most Posh Elves, Laelithar is dutiful to his <a href="Sir.html">Sir</a>, and proud to a fault. He's impatient and condescending, not shy to tell people their place, and belittle those he sees as his lessers.</p>
