<p>This region was formed as a diplomatically neutral point between The Elves and The Federation. As such, it is relatively lawless. It governs itself, with the help of Federation and Elven influences, but mainly controlled by forces within <a href="The Barket.html">The Barket</a>.</p>
<p>Light in this region of space is confusing, often just wrong. Whole planets go without sun for months, despite being in clear view of the sun. It sometimes simply doesn't land. The light gets lost on its way to the surface. No one has figured this out, but some believe that <a href="Photonic Space.html">Photonic Space</a> may be siphoning off solar power to their position on the far edge of <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a>, in the heart of <a href="The Void.html">The Void</a>.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<h3>Before the Party</h3>
<p>Before they were discovered and colonised by The Federation, The Party Planets were in communication with one another. Entities and ethereal species lurked in the darkness of these planets.</p>
<p>From this vantage point, <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a> first met and talked with <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, in talks that would lead to The Federation declaring war against The Elves, known as <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>. </p>
<p>The Party Planets, not then known by any particular name, remained unclaimed. The <a href="Grue.html">Grue</a> hid away in their void dimensions tucked into the dark corners still left, while the truly formless entities fought back against light. Some entities used sound and psychic powers to lure the invaders into the darkness to spirit them away, but this only half worked.</p>
<p>The forces at work in the dark knew how to lure people,  but not much of how to occupy them after that. Typically the would try to assume control over their victims and use them as puppets. They learned from their efforts how to enter the mind of the invading species, but never to control it. However, they got a taste for it nonetheless, and began seeking alien minds to piggyback off of. Humanoid feelings are such a rush!</p>
<p>The darkness got hooked on possession, a shift in its collective consciousness that so overwhelmed their nature that the darkness entities essentially became one mind, dedicated to maximising the comfort of their alien hosts. Now and then they would take the mind of someone in pain, and it sucked. This fighting had to stop, it was harshing the vibes of their hosts, and so the Darkness, as they call it, pushed further into their hosts minds to inhibit their will to fight while on these planets. </p>
<p>There developed an odd culture in these planets that became known during the last days of the war. The planets made people peaceful. Rowdy and reckless, but non-violent. It was like everyone who landed there felt emboldened by a peaceful spirit with a drive to have fun.</p>
<p>When the Elves had their decisive victory, pushing the Federation back into their own space, The Party Planets were chosen as the grounds for the final peace treaties to be signed off on, for its reputation as a calming place.</p>
<h3>Now</h3>
<p>The Party Planets were developed. They became party destinations and health retreats. The inhabitants have learned the quirks of the Darkness, and have studied it extensively. They're chill about it, although a lot of people who haven't visited think they sound brainwashed. Sure, a spirit of darkness crawls into the shadows and darkness inside of the body of everyone who visits, but it's also totally chill. Why would anyone be worried about something silly like being possessed by darkness itself?</p>
<p>Those who stay too long risk losing their mind entirely to the Darkness, which slowly exerts it's influence on minds until their control is absolute. No big deal though, just get to a light room for a detox. About 12 hours in a well lit room and you'll be cleaned up.</p>
<p>When the light returns, a depression washes through the populace as the Darkness retreats, and it's celebrated on its return.</p>
<h2>Thasawrap</h2>
<p>Thasawrap is the most well-used of <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a>, as a corporate and government getaway planet. It hosts peace talks and Christmas parties for all species across political borders.</p>
<p>It was here that <a href="The Cool Planets Club.html">The Cool Planets Club</a> was founded by members of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> after their defeat during <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>.</p>
<p>Some would consider it to be the capital planet of The Party Planets, although there's no official capital. </p>
