    <p>Outlines are black, grey, or white lines around things that keep their insides from falling out. </p>
<p>They can also be found encircling text in the form of speech bubbles, and tethering speech bubbles to their source.</p>
<p>Only <a href="Snerson.html">Sneeple</a> are capable of seeing outlines thanks to their <a href="Medium.html">Medium</a>-sensitive eyes.</p>
