    <title>Origin Planet</title>

    <p>The Origin Planet, known mainly to the <a href="Elf.html">Elf</a> people who once inhabited it, was the original mass in the universe. It had no moons, it had no sun, it had no rotation or orbit of any kind. It simply was, and all around it was light. It was a dot on infinite plane of white.</p>
<p>On this planet, the Light, which is the collective consciousness now divided into <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>, willed into being creatures of all kinds onto the planet, and tested them for efficacy. They advanced through different stages of development until they reached the critical point of the test: the explosion.</p>
<p>Pressure began to build in the centre of the planet, warning it's residents through increased tremors and geological disaster. If the species could survive this transition, the universe would be allowed to progress from that point onwards, in the trustworthy hands of a capable species.</p>
<p>Many failed attempts were made before the <a href="Elf.html">Elf</a> experiment. The Elves successfully survived the explosion by chaining together dense masses of earth and reinforcing their underground strongholds. When the planet did explode, their 3 core chunks of planet remained intact, and their people safe inside.</p>
<p>With the test complete, the Light contentedly dissolved into its component pantheon of aspects, and began to reside across the universe of separated planetary chunks.</p>
<p>The Elves, advanced as they were, saw this betrayal at the heart of their reality. In the absence of sufficient scientific explanation, only God was left to blame, and God it was, of a sort. <a href="Parliament.html">Parliament</a> and <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a> more broadly, developed a deep resentment for <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>.</p>
<p>The Royal Dominion began to repopulate the universe with rehashes of its old favourite experiments who sadly failed the transition from the Origin Planet before. These younger species grew afresh across the newly birthed universe, to the frustration of the Elves, who coveted their struggles as the survivors of the universe's beginning.</p>
<p>Much of the origin planet's secrets were hidden beneath the surface, and are now scattering the universe to be discovered.</p>
