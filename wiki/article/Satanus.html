<h1>Satanus</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>Satanus is a demi-god from a Hellish realm on the other side of <a href="The Scab.html">The Scab</a>. She tore a hole in our universe and climbed out. Hands as big as planets, she lifted herself through the open wound she'd made, and climbed into deep space, to parts unknown. </p>
<p>As she moved, demons, like bacteria, travelled from her skin to the planets she touched, and promised to do her bidding as she moved onto the next planet. They developed independently and then rejoined millennia later as <a href="The Bloody Consortium.html">The Bloody Consortium</a>, to do evil on her behalf, anticipating her eventual return.</p>
<p>She did not care, however. Her gaze had been fixed solely on a point of light beyond our vision, and she marched on, unaware of the demons she left behind. </p>
<p>She might not be evil, but she should have washed her hands before coming to out universe.</p>
