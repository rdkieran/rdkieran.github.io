<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>The crew of the <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> pirate vessel <a href="Spacebeak.html">Spacebeak</a> is in a dire situation. They've lost weapons and are losing life support. Another wave of enemy forces from <a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a> is on its way to finish them off.</p>
<p><a href="Feather.html">Feather</a>, a young go-getting pirate is determined to save them, despite the wishes of <a href="Captain Birdbeard.html">Captain Birdbeard</a> to activate the self-destruct sequence and kill themselves early. Not very honourable, if you ask Feather. </p>
<p>Through incompetence and bad luck, <a href="Feather.html">Feather</a> fails to save the ship, and is returned through a kind of time loop by <a href="Life.html">Life</a>, who in their benevolence has allowed the crew a number of tries to save themselves, returning to the last minutes before the <a href="Spacebeak.html">Spacebeak</a> explodes.</p>
<p><a href="Feather.html">Feather</a> ultimately fails, and it's left to their last try, at which point <a href="Peck.html">Peck</a> uses his hand of <a href="Mutiny!.html">Mutiny!</a> cards to devise a plan to save the day.</p>
