<h1>Blammo Bambano</h1>
<p>Blammo Bambano, ancestor to Federation co-founder <a href="Blubberbox Bambano.html">Blubberbox Bambano</a>, and current President of the <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>. As President his main job is to gesture at crowds and generally act as a friendly face to the ruling committees.</p>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Sprouted from the <a href="Bozo#Bambano Bush.html">Bambano Bush</a> during a particularly dry season, he was one of only two survivors of the year's crop, alongside <a href="Blabby Bambano.html">Blabby Bambano</a>. The two of them were talkative and merry as any Bozo despite the hardship of their early weeks.</p>
<p>Something was off about the two however. They moved in a strange rhythm that rang discordant to that of the other bush residents. They invented their own dances and perplexed the juices of the other Bozos around them.</p>
<p>As they grew, they fell further out of step with the rhythm of their bush, and began to fall into trouble. At first they found it fun, but eventually it drove a stake between the two, with Blammo insistent on conforming and avoiding isolation, and Blabby insistent on maintaining their unique personalised language.</p>
<p>The two fell out of sync, and as they came of age, their paths diverted. Blabby took to the stars to explore the fringes of space, while Blammo leveraged his unique perspective on his community to become a leader. Propelled by his work and his name, Blammo ascended to a high position in office.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Blammo began his career running twig collection and road maintenance around the Bambano Bush colony. </p>
<p>Essential survival skills are maintained in Bozo culture, despite the technological advances of their larger settlements based in the wastes of Bozotopia.</p>
<p>Blammo, with his altered sense of rhythm recognised an opportunity for change in traditional twig collection tactics. By changing the rhythm of their working songs, twig collection rates increased 20%. </p>
<p>Innovations in traditional, archaic work are rare. The committee saw potential in Blammo, and watched him carefully. Emboldened by his success, Blammo sought improvements in other areas of society, finding small improvements in several areas, building a reputation within local politics.</p>
<p>He ran for a position in the committee and got it with gusto. From this new position he could reach higher committees, looking into deeper political processes, and looking for opportunities to tune and resync.</p>
<p>His career continued in this matter, striking up through the ranks like an arrow, leaving nothing unchanged in his wake.</p>
<p>He was elected to President of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>, on the basis of his achievements and the weight of his voice. It's not ideal for him however, one who had so often shyed from the limelight, not a natural speaker, but learned due to necessity. Out of sync with many other Bozos, he presented a different character.</p>
<p>He rose to power in the wake of the establishment of <a href="The Cool Planets Club.html">The Cool Planets Club</a>, a distinctly anti-Bozo clique based in the <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a>, involving cliques from many Federation species. His unique demeanor appeals more to them, and made a necessary change to the synchronised leaders of recent memory, all Bozos all synchronised.</p>
<p>His current efforts as President are involved in making peace with The Cool Planets Club and maintaining relations with the <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>.</p>
