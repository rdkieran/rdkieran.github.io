    <p>The Trip of Triples are a member species of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> from the <a href="Triad.html">Triad</a>, a trio of planets named Planets I, II, and III.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Triples have three legs. Sometimes biology makes mistakes. Triples are named for their tendency to trip, although most believe that they're named for their three legs. Related, but not quite right.</p>
<p>Triples spend much of their life doing their best to train their coordination to deal with having three legs. Learning to walk takes a lot longer for Triples, because there's more to consider than for bipedal species. As such, their young require longer-term care. Triples' cognitive development outpaces their motor skill development, as they spend a lot of time staring at the ceiling as babies, learning to do as much as they can with their hands, making them quite dexterous and introspective.</p>
<p>Essentially, talking is all that Triple babies can preoccupy themselves with. And with their naturally fast-thinking brains, they make fast progress on this front during early development.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for Triples to learn how to speak before they can walk, and they are adept talkers. It's said that Triples developed their ability to chatter as a survival tactic, talking their way out of arguments with other babies, and out of fights with predators. </p>
<h2>Federation Membership</h2>
<p>The Trip fell into <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a> shortly before their official unification with the establishment of <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">The Woods#Too Big</a> as their capital planet.</p>
<p>Triples were the most active members of <a href="SpaceNet.html">SpaceNet</a> in the centuries leading up to the establishment of the Federation. However, they were <em>so</em> chatty that their impact dominated the channels they engaged with, and a lot of the time they were talking between themselves as a result. Their late addition to the Federation clique is a result of their being largely ignored online, as their dominating conversational style was difficult for other species to keep up with.</p>
