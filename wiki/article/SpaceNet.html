    <p>SpaceNet is the current state of the art platform synonymous with all interstellar data transfer and communications. It's used to host message boards, virtual reality, and entertainment resources. All of that, you know what I mean.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<h3>Beaky & Growf</h3>
<p>On <a href="Bozotopia.html">Bozotopia</a>, from the top of the Bithbath Bush, a <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> listened to space. Down below, the <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> danced, unaware. <a href="Beaky Eggson.html">Beaky Eggson</a>, a young member of the Bozo radio club, pointed his radar at a greenish shimmering light slowly drifting across the back of the sky. He picked up on a signal.</p>
<p>On the other side, <a href="Growf.html">Growf</a>, daughter of <a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> emperor <a href="Grizzledorf.html">Grizzledorf</a> carefully stimulated the luminous leaves of the upper canopy of <a href="The Woods.html">The Woods</a>, and watched for a reply.</p>
<h3>Blatherith Bithbath</h3>
<p>Each side quickly picked up on the discovery, and soon the two sides developed a shared language: <a href="Babble.html">Babble</a>. The leader of this on the Bozo side was <a href="Blatherith Bithbath.html">Blatherith Bithbath</a>, lead scientist behind the Bithbath Radio Club. On the Bear side, to honour his daughter's discovery, Emperor Grizzledorf allowed his daughter Growf to lead initial talks with Bozotopia.</p>
<p>The two worlds exchanged messages for some years, sharing knowledge and developing a close bond long before any other species intercepted and joined the conversation.</p>
<h3>The Rest</h3>
<p>After SpaceNet was established and growing as a multimedia platform, new species began to seek signals from space. </p>
<h4>sssSth & Paula</h4>
<p>Beginning with the <a href="Snerson.html">Snerson</a> and <a href="Roundoid.html">Roundoid</a> people, Snerson military scientist <a href="sssSth.html">sssSth</a> and Roundoid prisoner of war <a href="Paula (Roundoid).html">Paula (Roundoid)</a> made first contact from an isolated asteroid in <a href="S (Planet)#The Peel.html">The Peel</a>. The two had developed a tenuous alliance while stranded following an explosion on the Peel's surface. Launched I to space, they landed on an asteroid, making first successful passage to an extraterrestrial body. Attempting to contact their people, they intercepted signals from SpaceNet, setting into motion the end of <a href="The Swar.html">The Swar</a>.</p>
