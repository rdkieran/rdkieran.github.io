<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Barket is the black market within <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>. There is some confusion about the name, some believing it's a portmenteau of "Black Market", and some less-historically aware people thinking it has something to do with producing <a href="Dog.html">Dogs</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's simple. It was originally The Bark Market, a network of pirates dens nestled in the bark of the <a href="Skytree.html">Skytrees</a> that make up <a href="The Woods.html">The Woods</a> system. It started off in facilities dedicated to the extraction of <a href="Nectar.html">Nectar</a> from the Skytrees for synthesis of <a href="Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8.html">Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8</a>, the fuel used by spaceships. These facilities were numerous and are used as Barket dens. </p>
<p>The Barket is made up of many Federation species, and those outside of the Federation. However, it's mainly associated with <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> piracy, and <a href="The Baddies.html">Baddie</a> bounty hunters maintaining order. This is mainly rooted in old <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> prejudice against the Storks though.</p>
<p>The Barket exists wherever the hands of the Federation don't reach, or where disenfranchised members of the Federation meet, and gangs of those from outside the Federation, such as <a href="Elf.html">Elves</a>.</p>
<h2>The Elven Barket</h2>
<p>The Elven Barket is far removed from the Bark Market roots. When relations with the Elves loosened, and the Federation accepted Elves to visit, Elves with little prospects on their own worlds opted to instead find their fortune in the more socially fertile Federation. </p>
<p>Some of these Elves simply want to find a place to live a comfortable life without having to fight for it, and others want to use it to their advantage exactly because there is less fighting there. It's easy territory for those who are good at fighting, but aren't quite good enough to do it on their own planet, through legal means.</p>
<p>So places like <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a> and <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a> have a lot of Elven Barket activity.</p>
<p>In fact the Elven Barket is so sweeping in this region of space that it's almost a faction in itself, but not quite yet.</p>
