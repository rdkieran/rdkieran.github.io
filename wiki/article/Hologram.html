    <p>Holograms are photonic entities generated by complex holomatrices. Most <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">Federation</a> facilities are fitted with hologram generators to accommodate the use of holograms as workers and assistants, although these holograms are typically contained to specific areas and limited in the scope of their programming.</p>
<h2>Types of Hologram</h2>
<p>There are three main types of hologram: Worker Hologram, Recreational Hologram, and Sentient Holograms.</p>
<p>Typically a hologram's ability to understand the world is limited. In the case of worker holograms, this is limited to their functional role, and for recreational hologram it is limited to an understanding of their context in the scenario they exist in. </p>
<p>For instance, <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a> Crewmates <a href="Witch.html">Witch</a>, until recently was the cackling villain of the village of <a href="Westerfield.html">Westerfield</a>, which runs perpetually in the holodeck of the ship. Had she witnessed anything outside of the scope of middle ages Earth, she may not have been able to comprehend it.</p>
<p>However, Sentient Holograms do understand more. Some sentient holograms like <a href="Witch.html">Witch</a> retain their dependency on computer systems, still being a quantifiable entity in the system, while other holograms like <a href="Vod.html">Vod</a> were made biological.</p>
<h3>Sentient Holograms</h3>
<p><a href="Witch.html">Witch</a> changed from a Recreational Hologram stored in a Mental Block, to a Sentient Hologram following unknown conditions. </p>
<p>These kinds of glitches and transformations happen for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p>Interference with computer systems in <a href="Photonic Space.html">Photonic Space</a>, divine intervention, and maybe just a glitch are to blame. Sometimes they're just too well made, or not well made depending on your point of view.</p>
<h3>Sentience & Mental Block</h3>
<p>Let's get this straight. All holograms are sentient, or at least have the potential to be. A hologram like <a href="Witch.html">Witch</a> has simply broken the limitations of her Mental Block to become cognizant of her reality, while <a href="Stork Hologram.html">Stork Hologram</a> has not.</p>
<p>A Mental Block is a hologram's brain. It is is a section of unit of memory in Holodeck memory. Each object in a holographic space is one of these blocks. There are billions of blocks in a holo-generator, and so the number of reusable objects that can be created is effectively endless.</p>
<p>Different brands of mental block have different capabilities for forming their holograms. Recreational holograms like Witch utilise limiters designed for holonovel characters. </p>
<p>To ensure a holographic character cannot grow or become cognizant of its reality, it is assigned and limited to a certain set of variables inside of the Memory Block object. The holodeck's processor uses narrative logic to modify the objects to simulate cognizant thought. Narrative logic can change Mood variables and Posture variables, and the Narrative Logic dictates what conditions effect these variables in what way.</p>
<p>Villains may use alternative Narrative Logic to Heroes, for example, which guide the reactions within the Memory Block object. </p>
<p>However, Logic can act in unexpected ways when given access to extra variables. All Narrative Logic is adaptive, and so when presented with additional variables, it attempts to learn the correct reaction patterns based entirely on experience. This means someone like Witch may have villainous Narrative Logic, but her reactions to the world after she gained access to new variables in her Memory Block were chaotic and confused, until they settled on a winning strategy.</p>
<p>There are billions of potential variables, derived from AI learning sourced from hundreds of species.</p>
