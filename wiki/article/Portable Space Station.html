    <p>The Portable Space Station, or <em>PSST</em>, is a model of retractable satellite that can be folded up and towed between points in space to supplement trade routes and act as research facilities. There are hundreds of these across Federation space, clustered around interesting planets to survey phenomena, or drifting around trade routes in deep space as lighthouses and pitstops for passer-by.</p>
