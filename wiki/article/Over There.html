    <p>Over There is the farthest frontier of <a href="Federation Space.html">Federation Space</a> which juts into the side of <a href="Conspiracy Space.html">Conspiracy Space</a>. It's not got a lot going it, it's a bit of a no man's land, and politically unstable as well. Generally if you're sent there, you're likely being hazed by someone higher up than you.</p>
<p>As a borderland to <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a>, it serves as a diplomatic starting point for Elves entering <a href="Federation Space.html">Federation Space</a>, and those leaving for <a href="Conspiracy Space.html">Conspiracy Space</a>.  Because of this, there is a lot of <a href="The Barket.html">Barket</a> activity, and a lot of corruption. </p>
