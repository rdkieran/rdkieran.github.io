<h1>Alien Sarcophagus</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>The Alien Sarcophagus is an artefact discovered floating in space by <a href="Maddie.html">Maddie</a> and <a href="Charlie.html">Charlie</a> of the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>. They brought it on board expecting some kind of terrible mystery to reveal itself, but it ended up being benign.</p>
<p>It's been on the ship for 2 years now, to no major event. It trembles and groans when it dries out, so people take turns moisturising it.</p>
<p><a href="Rat Boy.html">Rat Boy</a> took a particular interest in it when he joined the crew with his dad, and took on primary moisturing duties. He has been thoroughly worn down by his frustration with it, and it's insistence on remaining a mystery.</p>
<p>Scans can't penetrate the casing, it seems that it was designed to withstand the void of space, and residue crusted on its surface reveals that it is incredibly old.</p>
<p>Something in there is alive, though, and so the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a> has been asked to take care of it and monitor it. It's thought that the <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">Federation</a> is just creeped out by it and doesn't want to keep it in any of their facilities, or maybe they've just got a backlog of artefacts to work through and don't have the space.</p>
