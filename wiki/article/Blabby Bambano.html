<h1>Blabby Bambano</h1>
<p>Blabby is a <a href="The Barket.html">The Barket</a> tech trader working out of <a href="Beep Boop 4.html">Beep Boop 4</a>. He trades technological curiosities from <a href="Conspiracy Space.html">Conspiracy Space</a> and <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a>, doing much business with the nefarious <a href="Institute for Finding Things Out.html">Institute for Finding Things Out</a>.</p>
<p>He is progeny of the famed Bambano Bush, from which many famous Bozos were sprouted, including his ancestor <a href="Blubberbox Bambano.html">Blubberbox Bambano</a> and current diplomatic Federation leader <a href="Blammo Bambano.html">Blammo Bambano</a>.</p>
<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Sprouted from the <a href="Bozo#Bambano Bush.html">Bambano Bush</a> during a particularly dry season, he was one of only two survivors of the year's crop, alongside <a href="Blammo Bambano.html">Blammo Bambano</a>. The two of them were talkative and merry as any Bozo despite the hardship of their early weeks.</p>
<p>Something was off about the two however. They moved in a strange rhythm that rang discordant to that of the other bush residents. They invented their own dances and perplexed the juices of the other Bozos around them.</p>
<p>As they grew, they fell further out of step with the rhythm of their bush, and began to fall into trouble. At first they found it fun, but eventually it drove a stake between the two, with Blammo insistent on conforming and avoiding isolation, and Blabby insistent on maintaining their unique personalised language.</p>
<p>The two fell out of sync, and as they came of age, their paths diverted. Blammo leveraged his unique perspective on his community to become a leader, while Blabby took to the stars to explore the fringes of space.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>Blabby started off as a horn-shiner for <a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a>, joining raids against the <a href="Young Aeronaut Raiding Group.html">Young Aeronaut Raiding Group</a>. With a keen eye for detail, he found he could identify valuable or unique pieces of technology to loot, and how to fix systems. He and his raiding parties did good trade with the <a href="Institute for Finding Things Out.html">Institute for Finding Things Out</a>, until he was caught by his comrades keeping valuable pieces of tech for his own profit.</p>
<p>Kicked out of <a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a> for his lack of teamworking spirit, he fell to his contacts within the <a href="Institute for Finding Things Out.html">Institute for Finding Things Out</a>. Here he could indulge his interests fully, working out potential uses for ancient technologies, and fixing and understanding alien technology.</p>
<p>He has met on different occasions other former Institute members <a href="Amy.html">Amy</a> and <a href="Jockey.html">Jockey</a>, while investigating technology from across the <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a>.</p>
<p>During his investigations into the <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a>, he fell in with <a href="The Barket.html">The Barket</a> who operated in this region, as well as the <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a> and <a href="Conspiracy Space.html">Conspiracy Space</a>. Since his time with The Baddies, Blabby had developed a much better tact for smuggling goods out of sight of his rivals as well as allies. With a store of stolen technology from the Institute, he embarked on his adventures in the illegal tech trade.</p>
<p>He started out setting up shops in the Party Zone and taking them down before anyone caught on. He continues now, setting up shop in space stations and ship stops across the Over There and the fringes of Conspiracy Space.</p>
