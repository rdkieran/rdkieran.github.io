<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Collective is a science collective-turned-cult working on a disused moon in <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a>.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Founded by <a href="Brenda.html">Brenda</a> and <a href="Hayley.html">Hayley</a> to work on genetic engineering and cloning as a means to recreate or revive the dead, but turned sour by opportunistic parties. </p>
<p>The Collective found it's funding through <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. They used this funding to set up a base of operations inside of an old mining facility, and enlist the help of <a href="Grundo.html">Grundo</a>, a disgraced <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> scientist who was exiled from <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a> for his illegal work in genetics.</p>
<p>Matters soured as Brenda was influenced by the pure scientific ideals of Grundo, leading to Hayley's departure from the organisation to parts unknown.</p>
<p>Left to their own devices, Brenda and Grundo continued their research into their artificial lifeforms. They drifted from their original intent to necromancy to eugenics. </p>
<p>You could say it was a bad turn, but it's pretty rancid either way.</p>
<h2>A Change in Direction</h2>
<p><a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elves</a> decided to push their influence as the project took shape. They placed the Elf <a href="Laelithar.html">Laelithar</a> to oversee the project, to take their research and give it purpose and direction.</p>
<p>Laelithar invested time in hiring new staff to populate their growing Collective. Brenda saw this as a welcome growth of the family, but Grundo, a veteran of <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>, saw it as Elven meddling, mistrustful of Laelithar's motives, and insulted by the excessively inclusive hiring policy.</p>
<p><a href="Squeakella.html">Squeakella</a>, a <a href="Rat.html">Rat</a> was hired for security. <a href="Jockey.html">Jockey</a>, a <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> was hired as a grafting and cloning specialist. Worst of all was <a href="Siana.html">Siana</a>, a <a href="Shitter.html">Shitter</a> hired to work directly alongside him. </p>
<p>All species in The Federation are embarrassed to be seen with Shitters. Too much giggling. They generally try to keep away from them, but The Elves had no such prejudice. In fact, the unfortunate naming was relatable to them.</p>
<p>Grundo couldn't stomach it, and departed from the Collective. He didn't make it, and at the request of Laelithar, he became the first piece of their ultimate aim: A new species comprising of all the greatest parts of all others. </p>
<p>I suppose it seemed like fun at the time.</p>
<h2>Loose Ends</h2>
<p>The Elves, in their speculative exploration of space, happened upon a strange species: <a href="Thread.html">The Thread</a>. Their reproductive biology was remarkable, a whole species cut from an endless <a href="Thread#The Spool.html">Spool</a>, a mass of sentient material woven into the fabric of their planet. What trick of nature allowed such a thing to exist?</p>
<p>Brenda and Squeakella travelled to the planet on orders of Laelithar to enlist a special recruit. Find one of these Thread people and bring them back for study. </p>
<p>Until now, The Collective had conducted experiments and research on its own members, who willingly gave themselves to testing on the understanding that it was for the good of their utopian goals of creating the ultimate species to unite them all. They didn't have great trope awareness.</p>
<p>A thread who agreed to leave the planet was found: <a href="Frayja.html">Frayja</a>. They were brought back to The Collective to a puzzled and intrigued reception. What a strange thing you are, they all thought. They were excited to have a new member of their family, and didn't see the sinister side of this kind of recruitment of less technologically developed species.</p>
<p>Siana made friends with and got to work on Frayja. She cloned, manipulated, and generally diced Frayja up, in search of their genetic secrets. The altered clones were sent out into space, and Frayja being a naive, friendly, and interesting alien, the people of the universe were happy to have them as a visitor without asking many questions.</p>
<p>The clones were sent on missions to gather intel from doctors, geneticists, anthropologists, bakers: anyone who would take an interest in a creature like Frayja would likely have research worth investigating for The Collective.</p>
<p>One of these clones was assigned to shadow <a href="Ihava Fullbody.html">Ihava Fullbody</a>, a <a href="Human.html">Human</a> geneticist working on cellular regeneration. And that's all I have so far.</p>
