    <p>Subspace Drifting is not yet a real story. It's an idea to develop a story inspired by racing movies, shows, and games. Fast and Furious, Redline, Speed Racer, Initial D, Racing Lagoon.</p>
<p>In space, high-speed travel is achieved by manipulating subspace collision planes. There has sprung up a thrillseeker culture for those who want to test their nerve and skills.</p>
<p>The form of this story may be a comic, it may not be. It will take place after the events of <a href="Space Story II The Wrath of Something.html">Space Story II The Wrath of Something</a> and <a href="Loose Ends.html">Loose Ends</a>. It can pull from the inclusion of <a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a> in <a href="Self-Destruct Sequence.html">Self-Destruct Sequence</a>. It could be used as a story for <a href="Sanna.html">Sanna</a> in a future Space Story entry, or it may be used as a <a href="Handa.html">Handa</a> story.</p>
