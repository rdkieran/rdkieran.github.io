<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uplifted animals (aka Animal People) are an artificial species created by <a href="Human.html">humans</a>, and inhabiting <a href="Animaltopia.html">Animaltopia</a>.</p>
<p>They are a sub-species of human, created artificially before the arrival of alien life to human-occupied <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a> (see: <a href="The Humiliation.html">The Humiliation</a>)</p>
<p>Although they were offered a place in <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> following their gift of the Pity Planets, the Animals made the decision to establish their society before committing to any further political affiliations. They receive support from the GFOCP, and have been steadily developing their society and culture since they were established 100 years ago.</p>
