<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Being part of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> is cringe. Being in <a href="The Bloody Consortium.html">The Bloody Consortium</a> is less cringe, but still cringe. Generally, being in part of any species-based society is also a little bit cringe. You should just hang out somewhere cool and do cool stuff. The Cool Planets Club knows what's up.</p>
<p>The Cool Planets Club, also known as The Gang, is comprised not of species, but of planets; those outside of any other <a href="Galactic Political Clique.html">Political Clique</a>, and those who want to distance themselves from the embarrassing sides of the Clique they belong to. </p>
<p>The Cool Planets Club engages more liberally in body modification, and have a league of superheroes called <a href="The Alliance.html">The Alliance</a>.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>The Cool Planets Club was founded on <a href="Party Zone#Thasawrap.html">Thasawrap</a>, the wrap party planet, following the Federation conference held after <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>, where The Galactic Federation of Planets changed its name to The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets. After the infamous speech by <a href="Max Velocity.html">Max Velocity</a> where the word <em>Consenting</em> was added to their title.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's super sad what happened out there folks. I know, I was there. And no, I'm not proud of it, and I'm proud that I'm not, because that makes me humble. And humility is the name of the game out there, folks. </p>
<p>You don't know it 'til you've seen it. How small and humble we are in the face of the universe. It's beautiful, really. This is what you're missing by not being out with us, out there in the stars. But I didn't come here today to say that. Just shooting from the hip. But think about it. Okay.</p>
<p>We are a Federation bound to our ideals. Sometimes that means pushing the envelope, but can you blame us? Nothing ever got done without a little risk involved. Haven't we all at one time or another, got caught with our hand in the cookie jar? Do you know that expression. Those human movies they have. No? Nevermind.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is... I don't know what. But what can you say, really, in the face of the universe? It's terrible what happened It won't happen again. That's a Federation promise! No more invading. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armado leader <a href="Torquemada Amadeus.html">Torquemada Amadeus</a> was sooo embarrassed standing next to Max Velocity as he delivered his speech. And even more frustrated when the crowd cheered him on. The Federation is mainly run by <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a>, and they were just so... Stupid. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>Torquemada said as much to <a href="Ursavus XI.html">Ursavus XI</a>, then-leader of the <a href="Bear.html">The Big Surprise</a>, at the wrap party for the war. The Party Planets are spread throughout <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a> and into the <a href="Rainbow Deathspiral.html">Rainbow Deathspiral</a>, between the territories of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>, and <a href="The Bloody Consortium.html">The Bloody Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>Torquemada and Ursavus XI decided they should make a club. Not a political one, of course not. Just a secret club where politicians can get together and make plans without the influence of all the uncool and cringey species and planets. It's a little dodgy. But as long as you're cool, you can join. That was the idea.</p>
<h2>The Gang</h2>
<p>The Gang is the name the member planets of the Cool Planets Club use to refer to one another. <a href="Armadoniapolisvilletopia.html">Armadoniapolisvilletopia</a>, and <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a> were the first member planets. Later joined by <a href="Coil.html">Coil</a> homeworld, <a href="Bozotopia#Tether.html">Bozotopia#Tether</a>.</p>
<p>An offer to join was extended also to the Elven planet <a href="Parliament#Riffindell.html">Riffindell</a>, seat <a href="The Elven Conspiracy#Laugh.html">House Lalaith</a>. The invitation was not formally rejected, but relations between House Lalaith and the gang are good. They meet up at room parties on the Party Planets sometimes and have a laugh together. They're sound.</p>
<p>The latest member planet to join the gang is <a href="Animaltopia.html">Animaltopia</a>, the planet gifted to the <a href="Animal.html">Animal</a> population after <a href="The Humiliation.html">The Humiliation</a>. Animal people are generally cool.</p>
<h2>No Bozos</h2>
<p>The Cool Planets Club has a strict No Bozos policy. Bozos are cringe and embarrassing. <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a> took offence to the establishment of the club. The ego of the Bozo people was already bruised by the rejection of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a> to join the Federation, but bruised further by the establishment of The Cool Planets Club, especially because it was established by their own member species. In particular, the gang being co-founded by <a href="Ursavus XI.html">Ursavus XI</a>, a descendant of Federation co-founder <a href="Ursavus.html">Ursavus</a>, caused a particular stir.</p>
<p><a href="Blammo Bambano.html">Blammo Bambano</a>, descendant of famed explorer <a href="Blubberbox Bambano.html">Blubberbox Bambano</a>, and current head of intergalactic relations, is currently in talks with The Cool Planets Club to encourage their dissolution.</p>
<p>However, it's clear to the masses that a lot of the bitterness by The Federation is fuelled by the Bozos' damaged ego. As they push the issue, talk builds about the Federation's bias toward Bozo interests, which increases bitterness toward the Federation, and makes it seem somehow outdated, and cringe. Resistance to The Cool Planets Club causes increased bitterness toward the Federation.</p>
<h2>The "Cool Mob"</h2>
<p>A lot of people, Bozo or otherwise, recognise that The Cool Planets Club is a bit petty and mean, though. There is a culture war within the Federation over people who appear "too cool" for good, honest Federation citizens. Coolness in The Federation is therefore much more overblown and silly, intentionally embarrassing and camp to counteract any suggestion that they are too aloof. The brand of coolness associated with The Cool Planets Club is seen as overly intellectual, and separated from the interests of common people. </p>
<h2>Relationship with The Baddies</h2>
<p><a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a> are a gang of upper-middle class pirates, started in response to <a href="Stork.html">Stork</a> pirate culture after the founding of the Federation. They've been around for a long time. Condemned by the Federation, but tolerated more readily than Stork pirates. This is because many members of The Baddies are rich kids from Federation planets playing vigilante despite their parents' wishes. They're so tied up with the social hierarchy of the Federation itself that it would politically unsound to risk killing and subjugating them.</p>
<p>The Baddies try so hard to be cool. They didn't want to be cringe Federation officers, and have been trying for years to avoid becoming embarrassing or uncool. When The Cool Planets Club was established, The Baddies showed up to a lot of their parties and tried to make connections. They began to cling onto everything The Cool Planets Club did, setting up bases around their planets and unofficially aligning themselves with The Club to win favour with them.</p>
<p>This in itself is cringe, and The Cool Planets Club resent this unrequested alliance. It makes them look bad, too; they don't want to work with pirates. And if they did want to work with pirates, they'd work with the Stork, because the Stork were <a href="Stork#History.html">screwed over by the Bozo</a>. The presence of The Baddies in their space makes it unappealing for Stork pirates to visit, which The Club would actually like.</p>
<p>The Baddies are just rich kids having fun playing pirates, thinking they're cool because they're successful at it, despite the fact that they only get away with it because their parents are in positions of power holding back Federation forces from wiping them out.</p>
