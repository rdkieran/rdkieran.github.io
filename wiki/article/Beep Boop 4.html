<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beep Boop 4 is a <a href="Portable Space Station.html">Portable Space Station</a> owned by <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>, currently orbiting the planet <a href="Termina.html">Termina</a>, investigating <a href="Termina#Moon.html">its moon</a>. </p>
<p>It briefly fell under control by <a href="Elf.html">the Elves</a> during <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>. Since then, it has remained a fringe vessel, investigating phenomena near the edge of Conspiracy space. Federation space stations have a kind of memory, known to engineers who work with them over a long time. <a href="Mechanical Sentience.html">Mechanical Sentience</a> is a popular theory to account for the strange behaviours of ships in times of stress.</p>
<p>During the war, Beep Boop 4 seemed to resist occupation by The Elves. They lost control of the systems, the station malfunctioned and seemingly threatened to crush the Elves inside by shifting into it's contracted form. The Elves gave it up for unusable, but when engineers returned to the station after the war, they found the repairs necessary to fix the ship were easier than expected, and it was back in working order.</p>
<p>The crew of Beep Boop 4 are very attached to it. </p>
<p>The Admiral in charge of Beep Boop 4 currently is <a href="Admiral Dog.html">Admiral Dog</a>.</p>
