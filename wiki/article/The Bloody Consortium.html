<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Bloody Consortium is a nightmare hellscape of torturous, hellish misery. They are awful. Every single one of them. Where members of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>, <a href="The Cool Planets Club.html">The Cool Planets Club</a>, and <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a> share member species between themselves, The Blood Consortium does not. If you're not a member of The Consortium, you're an enemy of The Consortium.</p>
<p>The Consortium come from <a href="The Scab.html">The Scab</a>, a galaxy-scale anomaly that scars the universe from some ancient calamity. For millions of years, infection has spread from the wound in the form of hellish mutations. Every planet in it's orbit is changed and influenced by chaos. Nightmare beings travel from the open wound of The Scab and inhabit the planets on the other side. Alien species settled there have become warped and sinister.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>The Bloody Consortium was first established by <a href="Satanus.html">Satanus</a>, a planet-sized demi-god from the other side of the Scab. Whatever realm she came from, she brought with her hoards of beasts that crawled on the surface of her skin and populated the planets as she climbed into our realm.</p>
<p>As she climbed into our universe, she left her demons behind her, and left to parts unknown. She's presumably still out there, and many of the demons at work in The Consortium believe that she will return, and that their job is to destroy the neighbouring worlds. However, it's unsure whether she dispersed them on purpose, or if they were just like bacteria to her. When we spread germs, do we expect them to go to work on our behalf? I don't think so, but maybe she <em>was</em> just a demonic super spreader. </p>
<p>Satanus isn't necessarily bad; she maybe just didn't wash her hands before she went climbing through our universe.</p>
<h2>The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</h2>
<p><a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a> are banded together against the forces of The Bloody Consortium. </p>
<p><a href="Life.html">Life</a>, in response to this existential threat, revised her policies on the afterlife. No longer would her subjects be held to one life only, she would give them a chance to live on as many times as possible. This would help slow the spread of the Consortium's infectious influence on the Galaxy by ensuring that the most talented of sentient species would be capable of living on and keeping the numbers up.</p>
<p><a href="Future.html">Future</a> was created to manage timelines, and curate the process of events to manufacture a desirable conclusion to the existential war with the forces of the Consortium, while Life ensured that death could be avoided for the sentient beings who made up the counter force.</p>
<p>Demons are not bestowed with souls, and once destroyed cannot return to try again. However, they do procreate in the usual ways, and so they will persist.</p>
<h2>Inevitably, We Lose</h2>
<p>It's known by the Royal Dominion that the Bloody Consortium will inherit the universe one day, but their goal is to maintain life for as long as they can before the demons take over. At least, that's how it usually goes.</p>
<p>This is not the first time this has happened. There were Federations and Dominions and Conspiracies unknown numbers of years ago. Demons invaded then, and took over, and became isolated from one another in colonies which became the planets we known now; <a href="Mars.html">Mars</a>, <a href="Bozotopia#Majoris Maximus.html">Bozotopia</a>, <a href="The Woods.html">The Woods</a>, and so on. It all comes back around.</p>
<p>One day, the demons that infect the universe will develop into civilised societies of their own, and somewhere down the line, some new infection will spread.</p>
<h2>Our Only Hope, The Collective</h2>
<p><a href="The Collective.html">The Collective</a> is a eugenics cult started by <a href="Triple.html">Triple</a>-xenobiologist <a href="Brenda.html">Brenda</a> and <a href="Troll.html">Troll</a>-geneticist <a href="Hayley.html">Hayley</a> to reverse death. The project was hijacked by <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, in particular <a href="The Elven Conspiracy#Live.html">House Cuil</a>, working with forces and beings from <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>. They want to find out ways to create new life to fight the forces of the Bloody Consortium, and invest in enterprises that seek to solve this problem. </p>
<p>House Cuil were convinced to push this agenda by the Royal Dominion. The Royal Dominion don't care so much if House Cuil have their own selfish desires in creating soldiers, so long as they keep the Bloody Consortium down as they do it.</p>
