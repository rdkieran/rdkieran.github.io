    <p>Bill is a <a href="Seer.html">Seer</a> on board the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>. He is romantically linked with <a href="Vod.html">Vod</a>. Bill loved an anomaly. </p>
<p>Seers come from non-linear space. They can see thoughts and future and past and feelings. They just see right through everything else and speak directly to people's souls.</p>
<p>He is a chatterbox, but he talks inside people's heads, so he's kind of quiet too.</p>
<p>Seers immerse themselves in this slice of reality as a kind of pilgrimage or spiritual exercise. They stay there for a time and then return to their realm.</p>
<p>Bill has bonded with <a href="Vod.html">Vod</a> due to their similar ages. Bill is a young Seer at only 400 years old, while Vod has about 400 years of memory, despite only being 2 years old. </p>
<p>They have a pretty strict code of conduct, the Seers. They're capable of omnipotence and non-linear cognizance. They have access to way more global permissions.</p>
