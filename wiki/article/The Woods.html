<p>The continental leaves of the Skytree bathe the planets' surfaces with a green-tinted darkness, and so the Bears who have settled here live within the Skytree itself, in dense subterranean root systems and trunk interiors so vast that they hold their own unique atmospheres and gravitational forces.</p>
<h2>The Big Surprise</h2>
<p>The Big Surprise is the collective term for all of Bear society, coined by <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> explorers when they unexpectedly found a thriving technological civilization inside of the tree on the outside of their star system.</p>
<p>Famed Bozo explorer <a href="Blubberbox Bambano.html">Blubberbox Bambano</a> was the first to meet with the Bear people, and their then leader <a href="Ursavus.html">Ursavus</a>. They got on like a house on fire, whatever that means.</p>
<h2>Gateway to the Stars</h2>
<p>The Bozo and Bears traded for hundreds of years. Sent envoys to one another and maintained strong relations. They've never ever had any trouble. </p>
<p>This relationship forms the foundation of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a>, as the Bears allowed the Bozo to use Too Big as a base of operations for their exploration into deeper space. Too Big remains an important diplomatic stopping point for diplomats from other worlds as they travel toward the Federation's centre on <a href="Bozotopia#Majoris Maximus.html">Majoris Maximus</a>.</p>
<h2>Too Big</h2>

<p>Too Big is the largest of the three planets that form the base of The Woods, alongside Too Small and Just Right. It is owned by <a href="Bear.html">The Bears</a>, but run by <a href="Bozo.html">The Bozo</a> as a diplomatic base for <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Federation</a>.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Too Big, being the largest of the three planets, has the most space on its surface. It has few mountains, sparse foliage, and it's atmosphere is stretched too thin to comfortably settled.</p>
<p>As a result, it was mostly ignored by the Bears for much of their history.</p>
<p>However, as relations with the Bozo grew, Too Big was increasingly developed with terraforming technology as a diplomatic centre for the Bozos' newly formed Federation. </p>
<h4>Metropolis</h4>
<p>As the Federation grew, more and more of Too Big was set aside for colonies and communities for other Federation members, spanning across the planet's mostly flat surface. Above all, the trunk of the Skytree loom, now glowing with a million lights like a big Christmas tree, illuminating the city below.</p>
<p>The planet began to develop into something of a cultural centre for the whole Federation as more and more cultures set down roots there. Even some non Federation worlds developed communities on the surface of the planet, although under careful supervision.</p>
<p>As a result of this growing importance, Too Big has been involved in many of the major Federation events.</p>
<h4>The Humiliation</h4>
<p>The first major diplomatic upset for The Federation, <a href="The Humiliation.html">The Humiliation</a> was the unstable and risky inclusion of <a href="Human.html">Humans</a> and their <a href="Animal.html">Animal</a> genetically modified subspecies to The Federation. </p>
<p>Too Big opened up areas of the planet to house the Animal population, but controversially didn't extend this same courtesy to Humans, for fear of their instability and persisting love for weapons.</p>
<p>Humans instead were taken as refugees into various colonies across the planet, where they grew again in number and established themselves as an obnoxiously persistent presence in every society.</p>
<h4>The Dabbling</h4>
<p>After the discovery of <a href="Elf.html">Elves</a> in deep space, The Federation embarked on a war to subjugate and take the Elves into their Federation. This poorly considered act became known as <a href="The Dabbling.html">The Dabbling</a>, and resulted in the establishment of <a href="The Elven Conspiracy.html">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, and the addition of the word <em>Consenting</em> to <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>.</p>
<p>Too Big was thankfully left out of this war, with military might stored elsewhere in Bozotopia to keep Too Big safe from being targeted for retaliation.</p>
<p>There were protests. The many peoples of the planet disagreed with the invasion of the Elven worlds, and this pressure, as well as the Elves forces, compelled the Federation to cease their invasion. Most people were frankly annoyed that the Federation had forgotten that war is generally considered to be a no-no.</p>
<p>The Elves were allowed to settle on Too Big as a gesture of apology. Not many of them moved to these settlements, however.</p>
<h3>Present Day</h3>
<p>Too Big remains an important cultural and diplomatic centre for The Federation, but as it grows, and mistakes and disasters mark the Federation's reputation, the populace becomes increasingly divided </p>
<p>Still great for a night out though.</p>
<h2>Too Small</h2>
<p>Too Small is the smallest of the three planets that form the base of The Woods, alongside Too Big and Just Right. It is owned by <a href="Bear.html">The Bears</a>, but is mostly ignored.</p>
<p>Small is a planet of extremes where it's said that lightning always strikes twice. Colossal mountains strike at the thick atmosphere, and deep oceans push down on the thin roots of its Skytree.</p>
<p>It's unknown how populated the planet is on account of its dense sprawl of manor houses, developed over thousands of years by old families living on the surface until it resulted in labyrinth of endless corridors.</p>
<h3>Manor Sprawl</h3>
<p>Too Small's extreme geography is woven with manor houses and architecture of huge variety, dense and endless, and very old. It's full of wonders and treasures which draw in adventurers, but few of them who go too deep can leave.</p>
<p>It's a slum, a rich slum full of rich people, who are lost and very far from civilization. Its extreme weather makes it impossible to approach by any kind of aerial shuttle, the only method of traversing it is through its network of manor houses and facilities. But as the sprawl expanded and condensed, the ways got obscured, and many people got lost in the halls. Few escape.</p>
<p><a href="Teddie.html">Teddie</a>, full name Teddie Bear, is from one of these old families, and grew up in the Sprawl.</p>
