<p>The planet and it's people were discovered after the establishment of the Federation and the advent of interstellar travel. Despite being a neighbouring system to the central <a href="Bozotopia.html">Bozotopia</a>, Armadonia was unannounced in the universe, sending and receiving no messages with <a href="SpaceNet.html">SpaceNet</a>.</p>
<p>Despite their lack of communications, the Armado had well-developed internal communications, ignoring the outside universe. </p>
<p>The airwaves on Armadonia are kept clear, to maintain a consistent rhythm across the planets surface. Armados walk in step with one another, following a hum that resonates through the planet. Their affinity to rhythm bears similarity to the sensitivity of the Bozo.</p>
