    <p>Clippers are a neutral predatory species that can be found in caves and moons in the <a href="Over There.html">Over There</a>, although they have been known to make their way further into <a href="Federation Space.html">Federation Space</a>. No one really knows how they manage to get from planet to planet, but they're annoyingly persistent. They have a home planet where their society is based, but nobody's been there.</p>
<p>The Clippers that have left their home planet are scientists, probing alien species for testing. They capture explorers and put them through mostly harmless tests of skill and mental fortitude.</p>
<p>For instance, they put <a href="Amy.html">Amy</a> through a dream test when she was captured on <a href="Rainbow Deathspiral#Redworld IV.html">Redworld IV</a> during an away mission with the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>, in which she killed seven Crewmates before being awoken and rescued from captivity. The Clippers learned that humans are feral and dangerous when cornered.</p>
<p>It's thought that the Clippers share their findings with one another, and it's been noted that Clippers don't tend to make the same mistakes twice, and rarely repeat their experiments more than once. They don't do physical harm to their subjects most of the time, and this is thought to be a rule of theirs, although there are some cases where the Clippers have seemed to break this rule.</p>
<p>There is a small community of Clippers in <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a> who conduct social experiments with high people, like spreading rumors and starting cults.</p>
<p>They're annoying, and mostly people try to ignore them.</p>
