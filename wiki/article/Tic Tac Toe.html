    <p>Tic Tac Toe is some kind of transported anomaly serving as a Gossip on board the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>While transporting <a href="Edosi.html">Edosi</a> back from an away mission, a mouthless but nevertheless talkative alien appeared in his place. When the transportation was retried, more of the same alien appeared, until there were three of them there, talking to one another. They left the transporter pad with their arms linked together, and they've been walking arm in arm ever since, going so far as to connect their uniforms together.</p>
<p>Because they were in a rush to get <a href="Edosi.html">Edosi</a> back from his mission, they overlooked the appearance of Tic Tac Toe and they've just been part of the furniture ever since.</p>
<p>They don't have any remarkable skills, but their commentary and companionship is welcomed. And sometimes they say accidentally helpful things. They were given the honorary role of gossip, acting as an informal PA system that can be relied on to relay information throughout the crew. They don't always have the best social tact, but they keep things interesting.</p>
