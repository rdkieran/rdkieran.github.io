    <p>Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8 is the breakthrough fuel source manufactured by the <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a>. Say what you like about the Bozo; they benefitted from the generosity of many species to establish themselves as the prime species in <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> hierarchy, but they manufactured Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8, and without it, the Federation would have never existed.</p>
<p>It was named for the two Bozos who discovered it; <a href="Blim Dizbizazzle.html">Blim Dizbizazzle</a> and <a href="Blam Bizzlebozzle.html">Blam Bizzlebozzle</a>.</p>
<p>Together they worked on developing <a href="Nectar.html">Nectar</a> sweets from the sap of the <a href="Skytree.html">Skytree</a> rooted to <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">The Woods#Too Big</a>. Their methods developed the most potent <a href="Nectar.html">Nectar</a> of any Nectaratier.  They marketed it as Blim Blam's Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle, and it was famous throughout the <a href="Bozotopia.html">Bozotopia System</a>. It was especially loved by <a href="Bear.html">The Bears</a>, who had worked with nectar for thousands of years without fully exploring its deeper qualities.</p>
<p>As they developed more and more potent <a href="Nectar.html">Nectar</a>, they found it multiplied in uses each time. They began testing the nectar for more uses, and released new versions of their nectar with a new set of uses each time. It was for the 8th iteration that they discovered it's use as a fuel for a new propulsion system: <a href="The HESS Drive.html">The HESS Drive</a>.</p>
<p>This was the most important development for Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle, and despite it's many uses, this became the use for which it is now most well known.</p>
<p>The development of Dizbizzazzle Bizzlebozzle allowed the Federation to expand into further star systems, eventually leading to it's broad influence it enjoyed later.</p>
