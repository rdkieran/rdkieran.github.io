    <p>S (pronounced "ess") is the snake god of the <a href="Snerson.html">Sneeple</a>, and namesake of their homeworld, <a href="S (Planet).html">S (Planet)</a></p>
<p>Many thousands of years ago, The Peel, an unravelled planet, reached out across space and latched onto the Snerson homeworld, with many believing it to be the mouth of a galactic snake injecting the venom of wisdom into their planet, thus exhausting it's life force and bestowing it upon their planet. </p>
<p>They named their planet after this galactic snake, and maintain the name until the present day.</p>
<p>As the Sneeple improved their scientific knowledge, they ventured up the husk of the galactic snake, and discovered the <a href="Roundoid.html">Roundoids</a> living upon it. </p>
<p>The Roundoids told them that the snake was in fact a planet that had unravelled after excessive fracking, and had collided with their planet.</p>
<p>The Sneeple, insulted by this idea, believed the Roundoids to be servants of The Orb, the spiritual rival of S. </p>
<p>Out of spite for the Sneeples' superstition, the Roundoids decided to follow The Orb and engaged in war against the Sneeple. </p>
<p>The war raged on for so long that the Roindoids came to believe that they were fact were the destined rivals of the Sneeple, followers of their god, The Orb.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a>, the war gradually cooled down, as the Bozo shared their technology and rubbed it in their face that the snake really was just an unravelled planet; a fact long-forgotten by both the Sneeple and the Roundoids.</p>
<p>Both the Sneeple and the Roundoids put aside their war out of embarrassment, and joined the Bozo's newly founded <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>.</p>
<p>While the conflict had ended, the generational resentment between Sneeple and Roundoids remains. </p>
