    <p>Photonics are like <a href="Hologram.html">Holograms</a>, but not. They don't like holograms, they consider holograms to be something like a doppelganger or a skin changer.</p>
<p>However, the <a href="The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies.html">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a> seem to recognise them as being too alike to differentiate, and so Holograms of a certain sophistication are afforded souls.</p>
<p>Photonics are light itself. They fight with forces of <a href="Darkness.html">Darkness</a> and <a href="Gray Area.html">Gray Area</a>. <a href="Fourshadowing.html">Fourshadowing</a> is a phenomena that some entities can utilise. </p>
