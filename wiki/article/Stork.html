<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Scurvy of Storks are a member species of <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> from planets across the <a href="Bozotopia.html">Bozotopia System</a></p>
<p>As second-class residents of a number of worlds, the Storks have no ancestral home world, leaving them mainly nomadic, resorting to a culture of piracy in the early days of the Federation, and to the present day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Storks have lived in the Bozotopia system for longer than the <a href="Coil.html">Coil</a> or <a href="Bozo.html">Bozo</a> know. Back when the Coil and Bozo were still just leaves and peas, the Storks were predators. They ate them all right up. </p>
<p>However, as Bozo society developed, Storks took on a different role. The Bozo reproduce by asking a Bozo tree to sprout a seed and create a child. The Storks took on the task of delivering these children to the new parents, gliding down from their high perches above the Bozo trees. Predators-turned-nannies.</p>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>As technology has developed, Bozo reproduction has become more and more of a task. Historical distaste for Storks lead to technological developments that made their position in society redundant. Some traditional Storks still work in this role, but it's niche and rarely seen.</p>
<p>Storks, as a flying species, were among those who pioneered the first spacefaring technology. Without their help, it's uncertain whether the Bozo would have made it to space when they did.</p>
<p>However, the Stork situation is still a minor tragedy. They were an integral part of Bozo society for years, and this symbiotic partnership allowed both species to flourish. The march of technology made this dependency obsolete, and the Storks were the ones to suffer.</p>
<h2>Piracy</h2>
<p>The Bozo and the Storks worked together to develop their space faring technology, but when the Bozo took to space largely without them, a real bitterness took hold. </p>
<p>Many Stork turned to piracy, plundering Bozo vessels to take back their share. This caused a lot of friction during the early days of the Federation.</p>
<p>The Bozo fought back against the pirates, which made them unpopular among Storks on the Bozo home worlds, and from the <a href="Coil.html">Coil</a>, who share more liberally with their own Stork population.</p>
<p>Storks are known across the Federation for their tendency toward piracy. Their roots as caretakers are mainly forgotten among talks of the issues they cause for trade routes and stuff like that.</p>
<h3>The Baddies</h3>
<p><a href="The Baddies.html">The Baddies</a> are a faction of criminal bounty hunters made up of many people from many species, although mainly bozo. They can be recognised by their characteristic mask. Pointed and tusked, pointedly aggressive.</p>
<p>Baddies join this club often not out of necessity, but for the thrill of piracy. Many of them come from well-esteemed families, playing at piracy for a while to ease a comfortable, bored existence.</p>
<p>This faction takes a particular interest in Storks, seeking them out for plunder more than anyone else, due to the group's historic roots as anti-pirate militia.</p>
