    <p>Throughout space there are many aligned and unaligned species that make their moves in factions or mind their own business. Then there are Things. Things are just individuals with no clear lineage, or with biology unique enough that they don't fit into any broad group. </p>
<p>There are classifications to help keep track of all the Things running around in the universe. If a Thing can reproduce, and creates a race of species as a result, they take on a new classification and are no longer an anonymous Thing.<br />
- Anomaly - Things that are known to have been made as a result of some kind of scientific mishap.<br />
- Nomads - Things with no clear origin. Presumably descended from something, but that something isn't known.<br />
- Divergents - Things that have knowingly diverged from their own species through enhancements and conscious evolutionary choices.<br />
- Hand Wave - I don't know!</p>
