<p>The Authorship is the first structure from which all other creations in the universe derive. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Mix two parts Star Trek and one part Adventure Time and allow it some years to ferment in my head. Produced is the lukewarm swill that are the Stories from Space. The results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>In reality, I sit down in front of my drawing tablet and come up with some drawings for a page, and write whatever nonsense takes my fancy. </p>
<p>In the more real reality of Space Story, I'm The Author; a non-linear extra-dimensional being made up of several dogs. These dogs each pilot Pawtrol Drones (aka Pawtrollers), special sub-space drones that move around behind the Space, populating it with Stories. They do this in service of The Authorship; a dog-faced space probe cutting through Space, spreading Pawtrol Drones to the populate a Storyless universe.</p>

<em>Left to Right: Robbies #1 to #4, named respectively: Lanky, Admiral, Scottie, and Sippy</em></p>
<p>The Authors are all <a href="Robbie.html">Robbies</a>; replicant consciousnesses running inside of Pawtrollers. They each take the form of dogs. In the case of Lanky and Admiral, these shapes are taken from characters they created within their own Stories. Of the four Authors, only Admiral has  finished any Space Stories, although Lanky and Scottie have worked on Stories of their own.</p>
<p><a href="Lanky (Author).html">Lanky</a> was the first to envision life in the universe in the form of the <em><a href="Handa.html">Handa</a></em> stories, but <a href="Admiral (Author).html">Admiral</a> was the first to compile finished reports; <em><a href="Space Story I The Piss and Shit Olympics.html">Space Story I The Piss and Shit Olympics</a></em>, followed by <em><a href="Self-Destruct Sequence.html">Self-Destruct Sequence</a></em> and a number of <em><a href="Space Diaries.html">Space Diaries</a></em>.</p>
<p>While Admiral worked on <em><a href="Space Story II The Wrath of Something.html">Space Story II The Wrath of Something</a></em>, <a href="Scottie (Author).html">Scottie</a> was created to take on a smaller project that would later become known as <em><a href="Loose Ends.html">Loose Ends</a></em>. The projects became scrambled together and The Authors' output stalled, as internal arguments ensued between Admiral and Scottie. <em>Loose Ends</em> had run well over schedule, pushing back Admiral's plans for <em>Space Story II</em>. Admiral swore he'd never let Scottie do another comic.</p>
<p>The two worked together to plan an escape route from the <em>Loose Ends</em> project. Around this time, <a href="Sippy (Author).html">Sippy</a> was created, for what purpose is not yet known.</p>
