    <p>Fourshadowing is an off-gray psychic mist. Like the <a href="Darkness.html">Darkness</a> of <a href="Party Zone.html">Party Zone</a>, but gray instead of black. A consciousness comprised of billions of resolved consciousnesses. Like midochlorians.</p>
<p>Fourshadowing leeches the continuity out of people. It draws out the memories of past selves, and all the lore people carry, and brings it to the surface. </p>
<p>It can erase memory, rearrange them at will. It happens to <a href="Garrat.html">Garrat</a>and <a href="Teddie.html">Teddie</a> on <a href="Termina.html">Termina</a>, as emitted by the <a href="Termina#Moon.html">Termina#Moon</a>. It was used on <a href="Sanna.html">Sanna</a> to keep her young, and it can turn back the clock on everyone it influences, mentally and physically. It does not effect <a href="Photonic.html">Photonic</a>.</p>
