<h1>Teddie</h1>
<h2>Depiction</h2>
<p>Teddie is a <a href="Bear.html">Bear</a> serving <a href="The Galactic Federation of Planets.html">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a> as navigator for the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>. </p>
<p>She is an amateur <a href="Hologram.html">holonovelist</a>, and authored the village of <a href="Westerfield.html">Westerfield</a>, <a href="Westerfield#Vinceprice Manor.html">Vinceprice Manor</a>, and the sentient holographic characters <a href="Witch.html">Witch</a>, <a href="Vod.html">Vod</a>, <a href="Donald Mackay.html">Donald Mackay</a>, <a href="Villain King Piss.html">Villain King Piss</a>, <a href="Sherlock Holmes.html">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and <a href="Moriarty.html">Moriarty</a>.</p>
<h1>Childhood</h1>
<p>She was born on <a href="The Woods#Too Small.html">Too Small</a> to a family wealthy in property but not much else, living in the mega sprawl of manor houses that weave around the sheer cliffs, dense jungles, and deep valleys of the planet's extreme terrain. </p>
<p>She lived far from the <a href="Skytree.html">Skytree</a>, and spent much of her childhood exploring the labyrinthine halls of her parents ancient estate. Not a lot happened there. It was mostly old rich people who wandered the halls. She read all the old tomes to death, seeing glimpses of life in them. Eventually she made the long journey through the manor network, through the squatters lands, to the fortress at the base of the Skytree, where she bought passage through <a href="The Woods#The Canopy.html">Canopy</a>, and eventually <a href="The Woods#Too Big.html">Too Big</a>. </p>
<p>It was her keen navigation skills that allowed her to escape the labyrinth of <a href="The Woods#Too Small.html">Too Small</a>, and this is what won her her place on the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a>. </p>
<h1>Career</h1>
<p>Teddie wanted to see everything the universe could offer, and she did. Too many times. Somewhere along the line, she stopped really caring about her original aims to explore space and write stories about it. She loved to make holodeck characters and settings and scenarios, but she never figured out how to commit to it. </p>
<p>She's frustrated, feeling stuck in her job, uninspired by her life, and burdened by the feeling that she's failed herself. She made promises to herself which she has not kept, because she never found the time and effort. She guards her breaks, and works on her creative efforts when she can.</p>
<h1>Children</h1>
<p>Teddie has several holographic children. Really she has hundreds, but only a few lapsed into sentience. They have expectations of her she cannot meet. She owes them a lot, but still feels she owes herself more.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="Vod.html">Vod</a>. A horrible monster turned bonafide sweetheart by an accident in <a href="Photonic Space.html">Photonic Space</a>, and some counselling from <a href="Bill.html">Bill</a>.</p>
<p>During <a href="Space Story I The Piss and Shit Olympics.html">Space Story I The Piss and Shit Olympics</a>, the holograms of the <a href="USS Voyeur.html">USS Voyeur</a> broke out of mental captivity.</p>
<p>Teddie tries not to think hard about her responsibility to these things she made, and is not necessarily proud of them. </p>
