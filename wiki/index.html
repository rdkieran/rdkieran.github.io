                <p>Here's all of my rambling Space Story lore that I've written down so far. It's incomprehensible, likely never to be committed to canon. But I like ideas, and I like having them available to read.</p>
                <p>At some point I may code in some kind of highlighting system to show the articles I actually think of as canon, but for now, nah.</p>
                <p>PS. Some of these links lead nowhere. I'll fix that later.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Admiral Dog</h2>
<p>!<a class="wikiLink" href="#admiral_dog.png">admiral_dog.png</a></p>
<p>Admiral Dog is an <a class="wikiLink" href="#uplifted_animal">Uplifted Dog</a>, newly appointed Admiral of <a class="wikiLink" href="#over_there">Over There</a>, stationed on <a class="wikiLink" href="#beep_boop_4">Beep Boop 4</a>.</p>
<p>He is motivated by anger. He's been let down, by others and by himself. There were promises he was made, and promises he made to himself, and he's compromised on those promises over and over again. Now what is he doing? Every day is a lottery and he's not really expecting to win anymore. No surprises, no opportunities. Just work, no aim. He looks at himself and he thinks: I've failed you, and he gets angry at himself for that failure, because it's him in the mirror that he's blaming, no one else.</p>

<div id="alien_sarcophagus" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Alien Sarcophagus</h2>
<p>The Alien Sarcophagus is an artefact discovered floating in space by <a class="wikiLink" href="#maddie">Maddie</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#charlie">Charlie</a> of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>. They brought it on board expecting some kind of terrible mystery to reveal itself, but it ended up being benign.</p>
<p>It's been on the ship for 2 years now, to no major event. It trembles and groans when it dries out, so people take turns moisturising it.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#rat_boy">Rat Boy</a> took a particular interest in it when he joined the crew with his dad, and took on primary moisturing duties. He has been thoroughly worn down by his frustration with it, and it's insistence on remaining a mystery.</p>
<p>Scans can't penetrate the casing, it seems that it was designed to withstand the void of space, and residue crusted on its surface reveals that it is incredibly old.</p>
<p>Something in there is alive, though, and so the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a> has been asked to take care of it and monitor it. It's thought that the <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">Federation</a> is just creeped out by it and doesn't want to keep it in any of their facilities, or maybe they've just got a backlog of artefacts to work through and don't have the space.</p>

<div id="allspecies™" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Allspecies™</h2>
<p>The Allspecies™, commonly known as "The Collective" or "Whatchimacallits" is a biologically adaptive hivemind race of Frankenstein's monsters.</p>
<p>Where Holograms are mentally adaptive with limited physiologically, Allspecies™ are biologically adaptive, with limited mental abilities.</p>
<p>It is named for <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_collective">The Collective</a>, a small faction of scientists which created it, after their original aims were corrupted by the influence of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, in particular <a class="wikiLink" href="#laelithar">Laelithar</a> and his family.</p>
<p>The development of the Allspecies™ began as an exercise in reversing death by <a class="wikiLink" href="#triple">Triple</a> philosopher <a class="wikiLink" href="#brenda">Brenda</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#troll">Troll</a> geneticist <a class="wikiLink" href="#hayley">Hayley</a>. They sought funding through <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_barket">The Barket</a> to establish a base of operations on <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a>. They enlisted the help of <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> scientist <a class="wikiLink" href="#grundo">Grundo</a>, and others. Their funding came from <a class="wikiLink" href="#laelithar">Laelithar</a>'s family, working secretly within <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a> to develop technology to advance their interests in <a class="wikiLink" href="#conspiracy_space">Conspiracy Space</a>.</p>
<p>The key genetic components that allow the Allspecies™ to do its thing are <a class="wikiLink" href="#beeple">Beeple</a> collective thought, <a class="wikiLink" href="#thread">Thread</a> spontaneous generation, and regenerative genetic technology developed by the <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Human</a> scientist <a class="wikiLink" href="#ihava_fullbody">Ihava Fullbody</a>.</p>

<div id="amy" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Amy</h2>
<p>Amy is a <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Human</a>, serving <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> as a communications officer on board the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>She has served under <a class="wikiLink" href="#captain">Captain</a> for several years, enjoying the highs and lows of the space mystery life. She is deadly with a rifle, with a quick temper when threatened. </p>
<p>On an away mission in the mines of <a class="wikiLink" href="#redworld_iv">Redworld IV</a>, she was imprisoned by <a class="wikiLink" href="#clippers">Clippers</a>. While in a mental prison, she lucid dreamed herself aboard the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a> where she killed seven of her fellow Crewmates in a confused rage before she was released from captivity. Ever since, she's been quick to defend herself, and unsure of her reality.</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>She was born on <a class="wikiLink" href="#mars">Mars</a>, in the slums of capital colony <a class="wikiLink" href="#new_wick">New Wick</a>. She won a scholarship to study at <a class="wikiLink" href="#institute_for_finding_things_out">Institute for Finding Things Out</a>, where she was the only human in her year. She became friends with a <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork">Stork</a> called <a class="wikiLink" href="#jockey">Jockey</a>, who was himself the only of his species that year.</p>
<p>Her first post following her graduation was at a communications outpost in deep space, facing <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_void">The Void</a>, where she worked with <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> transmissions engineer <a class="wikiLink" href="#dorbobbie_dumbo">Dorbobbie Dumbo</a>.</p>
<p>They worked together in absolute silence for a year, monitoring signals from deep space, searching for signs of communication. One day, Amy received a signal. When she accidentally spoke aloud in excitement, she was quickly sent back to <a class="wikiLink" href="#federation_space">Federation Space</a> for reassignment. </p>
<p>The outpost was subsequently quietly dismantled and quietly moved several thousands miles away, to avoid lingering noise pollution from her raised whisper, reverberating in space.</p>
<p>She still puzzles over the content of the message she received, which unfortunately left no trace on the system. She is unsure whether she saw it at all. She is haunted by it.</p>

<p>It briefly fell under control by <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">the Elves</a> during <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>. Since then, it has remained a fringe vessel, investigating phenomena near the edge of Conspiracy space. Federation space stations have a kind of memory, known to engineers who work with them over a long time. <a class="wikiLink" href="#mechanical_sentience">Mechanical Sentience</a> is a popular theory to account for the strange behaviours of ships in times of stress.</p>
<p>During the war, Beep Boop 4 seemed to resist occupation by The Elves. They lost control of the systems, the station malfunctioned and seemingly threatened to crush the Elves inside by shifting into it's contracted form. The Elves gave it up for unusable, but when engineers returned to the station after the war, they found the repairs necessary to fix the ship were easier than expected, and it was back in working order.</p>
<p>The crew of Beep Boop 4 are very attached to it. </p>
<p>The Admiral in charge of Beep Boop 4 currently is <a class="wikiLink" href="#admiral_dog">Admiral Dog</a>.</p>

<p>Seers come from non-linear space. They can see thoughts and future and past and feelings. They just see right through everything else and speak directly to people's souls.</p>
<p>He is a chatterbox, but he talks inside people's heads, so he's kind of quiet too.</p>
<p>Seers immerse themselves in this slice of reality as a kind of pilgrimage or spiritual exercise. They stay there for a time and then return to their realm.</p>
<p>Bill has bonded with <a class="wikiLink" href="#vod">Vod</a> due to their similar ages. Bill is a young Seer at only 400 years old, while Vod has about 400 years of memory, despite only being 2 years old. </p>
<p>They have a pretty strict code of conduct, the Seers. They're capable of omnipotence and non-linear cognizance. They have access to way more global permissions.</p>

No one really knows how they manage to get from planet to planet, but they're annoyingly persistent. They have a home planet where their society is based, but nobody's been there.</p>
<p>The Clippers that have left their home planet are scientists, probing alien species for testing. They capture explorers and put them through mostly harmless tests of skill and mental fortitude.</p>
<p>For instance, they put <a class="wikiLink" href="#amy">Amy</a> through a dream test when she was captured on <a class="wikiLink" href="#redworld_iv">Redworld IV</a> during an away mission with the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>, in which she killed seven Crewmates before being awoken and rescued from captivity. The Clippers learned that humans are feral and dangerous when cornered.</p>
<p>It's thought that the Clippers share their findings with one another, and it's been noted that Clippers don't tend to make the same mistakes twice, and rarely repeat their experiments more than once. They don't do physical harm to their subjects most of the time, and this is thought to be a rule of theirs, although there are some cases where the Clippers have seemed to break this rule.</p>
<p>There is a small community of Clippers in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a> who conduct social experiments with high people, like spreading rumors and starting cults.</p>

Say what you like about the Bozo; they benefitted from the generosity of many species to establish themselves as the prime species in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> hierarchy, but they manufactured Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8, and without it, the Federation would have never existed.</p>
<p>It was named for the two Bozos who discovered it; <a class="wikiLink" href="#blim_dizbizazzle">Blim Dizbizazzle</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#blam_bizzlebozzle">Blam Bizzlebozzle</a>.</p>

Their methods developed the most potent <a class="wikiLink" href="#nectar">Nectar</a> of any Nectaratier.

It was especially loved by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">The Bears</a>, who had worked with nectar for thousands of years without fully exploring its deeper qualities.</p>
<p>As they developed more and more potent <a class="wikiLink" href="#nectar">Nectar</a>, they found it multiplied in uses each time. They began testing the nectar for more uses, and released new versions of their nectar with a new set of uses each time. It was for the 8th iteration that they discovered it's use as a fuel for a new propulsion system: <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_hess_drive">The HESS Drive</a>.</p>
<p>This was the most important development for Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle, and despite it's many uses, this became the use for which it is now most well known.</p>
<p>The development of Dizbizzazzle Bizzlebozzle allowed the Federation to expand into further star systems, eventually leading to it's broad influence it enjoyed later.</p>

<div id="elf" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Elf</h2>
<p>Elves are the founders of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, banded together as one people after their attempted forced assimilation into <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a>.</p>
<p>They come in many shapes and sizes, but as a rule, they always have big hands, and some kind of mystical abilities.</p>
<p>There are two main subspecies of Elf: Posh Elf and War Elf, and a third subspecies hunted to obscurity, the Yoga Elves. Of the three, the Posh Elves are the weakest in power, the War Elves are the weakest in will, and the Yoga Elves are the strongest in both, which the other two don't appreciate.</p>
<h2>Posh Elf</h2>
<p>Posh Elves, or <em>Poshos</em>, are the leader class of Elves. They are tall, dark haired, point-eared people with long, sharp fingers that form spade-like wedges on the end of their spindly arms.</p>
<p>They seem to float as they walk, and find a way to look down on everyone, even when they're lying on their back.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>Posh Elves have some mystical ability to see into the minds of others and extract information. They do this through physical contact with the head, accessing memories, thoughts, and feelings.</p>
<h3>Known Poshos</h3>
<ul>
<li><a class="wikiLink" href="#laelithar">Laelithar</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>War Elf</h2>
<p>War Elves, aka Dwarves, are a more physically tough variant of Elf, with backgrounds in mining and technological knowledge.</p>
<p>They are big, square things with coarse black hair and heavy armoured suits. Many of them wear visors that subdue their latent psychic powers.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>War Elves fear their powers, and have built their culture around their suppression. They are less compassionate, less emotionally vulnerable, for fear of the volatility of their psychic abilities.</p>
<p>Their visors suppress their powers, but without them, their powers would be dangerous to themselves and others. Their mental link to others is challenging to control, melding minds with others in a way that becomes difficult to untangle. Only Yoga Elves are capable of untangling themselves from the mind of a War Elf.</p>
<p>It's like a kind of reckless empathy that's uncomfortable to be stuck in, and difficult to escape. Except it does psychic damage. </p>
<p>Poshos look down on them for their lack of control over their abilities.</p>
<h2>Yoga Elf</h2>
<p>They have the same dark hair, pointy ears, and shovel-like hands, but tend to be short compared to the average Posh Elf. However, this makes little difference overall, and they can pass by unnoticed among other Posh Elves.</p>
<p>Because of their more potent abilities, Yoga Elves have been feared, hunted, and exiled by Posh Elf society for many years. As a result, they have a greater affinity for other species, which serves to reinforce the Posh Elves' latent xenophobia.</p>
<h3>Powers</h3>
<p>Yoga Elves share the Posh Elves' powers, but their abilities go beyond simply reading minds, but writing and rewriting them, and extracting the inner worlds of others into the physical realm.</p>
<p>This means that they can see and restructure someone's identity through mind manipulation in the case of the War Elf <a class="wikiLink" href="#ixtal">Ixtal</a>, or extract past selves from someone's past and give them a physical form, as happened to <a class="wikiLink" href="#squeakella">Squeakella</a>.</p>

<div id="hologram" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Hologram</h2>
<p>Holograms are photonic entities generated by complex holomatrices. Most <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">Federation</a> facilities are fitted with hologram generators to accommodate the use of holograms as workers and assistants, although these holograms are typically contained to specific areas and limited in the scope of their programming.</p>
<h2>Types of Hologram</h2>
<p>There are three main types of hologram: Worker Hologram, Recreational Hologram, and Sentient Holograms.</p>
<p>Typically a hologram's ability to understand the world is limited. In the case of worker holograms, this is limited to their functional role, and for recreational hologram it is limited to an understanding of their context in the scenario they exist in. </p>
<p>For instance, <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a> Crewmates <a class="wikiLink" href="#witch">Witch</a>, until recently was the cackling villain of the village of <a class="wikiLink" href="#westerfield">Westerfield</a>, which runs perpetually in the holodeck of the ship. Had she witnessed anything outside of the scope of middle ages Earth, she may not have been able to comprehend it.</p>
<p>However, Sentient Holograms do understand more. Some sentient holograms like <a class="wikiLink" href="#witch">Witch</a> retain their dependency on computer systems, still being a quantifiable entity in the system, while other holograms like <a class="wikiLink" href="#vod">Vod</a> were made biological.</p>
<h3>Sentient Holograms</h3>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#witch">Witch</a> changed from a Recreational Hologram stored in a Mental Block, to a Sentient Hologram following unknown conditions. </p>
<p>These kinds of glitches and transformations happen for a variety of reasons. </p>
<p>Interference with computer systems in <a class="wikiLink" href="#photonic_space">Photonic Space</a>, divine intervention, and maybe just a glitch are to blame. Sometimes they're just too well made, or not well made depending on your point of view.</p>
<h3>Sentience &amp; Mental Block</h3>
<p>Let's get this straight. All holograms are sentient, or at least have the potential to be. A hologram like <a class="wikiLink" href="#witch">Witch</a> has simply broken the limitations of her Mental Block to become cognizant of her reality, while <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork_hologram">Stork Hologram</a> has not.</p>
<p>A Mental Block is a hologram's brain. It is is a section of unit of memory in Holodeck memory. Each object in a holographic space is one of these blocks. There are billions of blocks in a holo-generator, and so the number of reusable objects that can be created is effectively endless.</p>
<p>Different brands of mental block have different capabilities for forming their holograms. Recreational holograms like Witch utilise limiters designed for holonovel characters. </p>
<p>To ensure a holographic character cannot grow or become cognizant of its reality, it is assigned and limited to a certain set of variables inside of the Memory Block object. The holodeck's processor uses narrative logic to modify the objects to simulate cognizant thought. Narrative logic can change Mood variables and Posture variables, and the Narrative Logic dictates what conditions effect these variables in what way.</p>
<p>Villains may use alternative Narrative Logic to Heroes, for example, which guide the reactions within the Memory Block object. </p>
<p>However, Logic can act in unexpected ways when given access to extra variables. All Narrative Logic is adaptive, and so when presented with additional variables, it attempts to learn the correct reaction patterns based entirely on experience. This means someone like Witch may have villainous Narrative Logic, but her reactions to the world after she gained access to new variables in her Memory Block were chaotic and confused, until they settled on a winning strategy.</p>
<p>There are billions of potential variables, derived from AI learning sourced from hundreds of species.</p>

<p>They GFOCP would typically respond to cataclysmic events like this by terraforming a planet as a gift, but it was decided that it would be unwise to give the humans a third planet to destroy.</p>
<p>And so humans find themselves a nomadic people, scattered across space. It's said they can be found in groups in every populated system in the universe. Their invasive curiosity infects the universe.</p>
<h2>Mean Spirited Little Creatures</h2>
<p>Humans are a very lonely species. They lived too far away from all the wonders of the universe to enjoy them, and were purposefully excluded for hundreds of years. <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a> could have helped, humans could have been in the Federation in the 1800s. But following their investigations into human culture decided, they weren't worth the risk. Mean spirited little creatures.</p>
<p>It's hard to deny the reputation of humans when they made the movies themselves. Human movies quickly spread in the culture-starved Federation, which hadn't invited a new member species in decades. The movies linger on a lot of the negative aspects of human culture, and so it hasn't made the best impression on the rest of the galaxy.</p>
<p>It's hard for aliens to understand. They're from the majority part of space where it's bustling with life on every other planet. This was a fact that was obscured by Federation technology to keep Humans from getting too excited about going to space. Humans thought for years that they were alone in the universe, limited for too long to their lonely corner of the galaxy.</p>
<h2>Uplifted Animals</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#uplifted_animal">Uplifted Animal</a> are considered to be a sub-species of Human, being something like a genetically engineered parallel. After the humans were initially refused Federation membership, they got really lonely, and decided that if the aliens wouldn't have them, they could make aliens of their own. Humans still continue to create uplifted animals. It's something the Federation should really address at some point.</p>

<p>Laelithar is a <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf#posh_elf">Posh Elf</a>, assigned to <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_collective">The Collective</a> as an overseer on behalf of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. He reports to his <a class="wikiLink" href="#sir">Sir</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the departure of Hayley, Laelithar was assigned to keep the Collective project from falling apart due to management conflicts. Under his supervision, the project enlisted help from across the universe, a broad range of species to bolster their ranks and diversify the genetic reference material. </p>
<p>As the work of the Collective has developed, he has become less careful in his treatment of its researchers, more likely to show his true distaste for them.</p>
<h2>The Collective</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_collective">The Collective</a> is funded by Laelithar's <a class="wikiLink" href="#sir">Sir</a>. Laelithar is, secretly, the son of his Sir. Where some members of the cast may assume that this is a high level play by <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, it is in fact just a small-time scheme by petty Kings to scratch together petty influence. </p>
<p>Laelithar will one day take over his dad's job, and his daughter will have his job when he moves on, ever pressing forward for better social standing in their impossibly dense society. This is their latest plot. A species that evolves by consuming the parts of other species. If they can supercharge their evolution, maybe their family can advance in Elven society faster. Genetic engineering and cloning and immortality and omnipotence are all part of higher Elven society, but they would never let that trickle down to someone as low as Laelithar and his family.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like most Posh Elves, Laelithar is dutiful to his <a class="wikiLink" href="#sir">Sir</a>, and proud to a fault. He's impatient and condescending, not shy to tell people their place, and belittle those he sees as his lessers.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Money</h2>
<p>Money (~~M~~) is currency. Big ones. It's what all the new Galactic Unions want. It's used by <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_bloody_consortium">The Bloody Consortium</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_cool_planets_club">The Cool Planets Club</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. </p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_royal_dominion_of_heavenly_bodies">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a> have their own currency, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> does not use currency at all.</p>
<h2>The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</h2>
<h3>~~M~~ is Good! / ~~M~~ is Bad!</h3>
<p>The Federation is an optimised communist society. It's perfect if that's all you want: an education, a house, a job, and nice places to spend time with people you love.</p>
<p>However, you have autonomy in this society, and you might want more than that. A private ship to take you to the pleasure planet without having to share a carriage with other people.</p>
<p>These things exist, but they cannot be bought. You get them through favours and trades. This means that the Federation operates on social currency, and the way to build social currency is to scramble for positions of power within organisations like The Federation.</p>
<p>However, the Federation was made by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">The Bozo</a>. They got in on the ground floor and populated all the best jobs and best positions, and passed them onto their friends and family. Idealistic as ever, they don't really see the issue. They got there first, why should they give up their seat?</p>
<h3>Pimp My Federation</h3>
<p>So what do you do to afford a life more comfortable than the average Federation citizen? Do you get a job in The Federation? Impress enough people in the Federation that they maybe give you a nice room, or some Colonists offer you a plot of land to bring your skills to their planet. It might happen, but there aren't many positions that will get you there. And most of the people in those jobs are Bozo anyway.</p>
<p>This problem may have been around for a while. The Federation was slowing down. After hundreds of years of expansion into space, they hit an obstacle they couldn't absorb for their own growth: <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">The Elves</a>. It was a brick wall. For the first time, something was in the way that The Federation, or more rightly The Bozo, couldn't overcome. The Elves refused to join and, refused to interact.</p>
<p>This frustration lead to <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a> which, while it ended in defeat for The Federation, succeeded in entangling their societies. Elves moved to Federation planets, and began to absorb the socialist ideals of The Federation. But equally, The Elves answered with their own influence: </p>
<h3>~~M~~oney Talks</h3>
<p>Shops opening up in fringe facilities, people getting a hold of the currency, and realising that it is power given physical form. People will do things for it, they will give you things for it. They'll do jobs no one wants to do, give you extravagant things that aren't yours. </p>
<p>The Federation doesn't have anything like this. You can't pick IOUs off of the street and cash them in for goods and services. You can't trade in personal favours with people who don't know one another.</p>
<p>But goodwill also doesn't run out as long as it goes back and forth forever. The same is not true for ~~M~~oney. Eventually it ends up in the pocket of someone playing the game. It's a game of tricks and deceit. The game of social graces and kindness in exchange for gestures of goodwill is a better game, but you can't profit from it. You <em>can</em> profit from ~~M~~oney, though.</p>
<p>And in a world where goodwill and kindness doesn't earn you anything because the people at the top don't intend to move? Then maybe the game of kindness isn't going to pay off. You stand a better chance investing in ~~M~~oney over goodwill. You can rely on it better, right?</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of people think this, and you can't blame them if the kindness and goodwill game isn't giving them what they need to live the life they see the Bozos enjoy as the perks of their often unearned social standing. Capitalism thrives in a culture of inequality, where everyone is desperate to have some say in their share of the pie. For fear of one day going hungry, living a life that's beneath anyone's standards.</p>
<p>~~M~~oney is accepted on the more metropolitan worlds, and on the many space stations that mark the trade routes between worlds. It's here, we have it now, and people are starting to catch onto what it can do for them.</p>

<p>Rats are everywhere. From what I've witnessed, they always have been. Little rats that scurry around, big rats that gnaw on mountains, 5th-Dimensional rats who hassle 4th-Dimensional cats. Not all of them can speak, but all of them can squeak. I've seen it.</p>
<h2>Origin Theories</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Humans</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozos</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#coil">Coils</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">Elves</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#list_of_species">everyone</a>. They've all known about rats long before they joined them in exploring the stars. Rats have lived alongside all species in the universe, as pests, pets, predators, and pals. Their omnipresence is almost unsettling, and different cultures have their own theories on this.</p>
<h3>Rats are God</h3>
<p>The theory goes like this. Rats are great. Everybody has them because they're just the optimal creature. There's something about them, whatever shape they take, that evolution just likes. They're perfect, and surely they are the true image of God.</p>
<p>Most people who like this theory stop short at the God part. Space has so many mysteries that you could create a religion out of, and of those mysteries the rat one is a little weak.</p>
<h3>Cosmic Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Some people who insist on rats being a pest species believe that they were somehow incepted by a higher being with sinister motives. Some cross over with the God theory and believe that they were a gift, but most people who go with the inception theory think that they're up to something.</p>
<p>Nobody says <em>what</em> they or their creator might be up to. Just something.</p>
<h3>Lab Rats</h3>
<p>Xenobiologists suggest that there's a trend in rat evolution across the universe that suggests they may have been introduced in a certain order to different worlds, by some kind of bioengineering species. Subtle differences in rats on neighbouring planets suggest a pattern of iteration. </p>
<p>Some more whimsical xenobiologists believe that if we could follow the trail of rats through space, we could eventually catch up to this engineering species. Books on this theory litter the shelves of every xenobiology bookshop in the universe. Frankly, people are sick of it.</p>
<h3>We're Just Rat People, Stop Being Weird</h3>
<p>This is the common stance by the rat population. The <em>Riddle of Rats</em> consider themselves to be one species and one community, despite their differences. Frankly, they find the insistence on explaining these differences to be insulting, and annoying.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Stork</h2>
<p>The Beauty of Birdies are a member species of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> from planets across the <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_bozotopia_system">The Bozotopia System</a></p>
<p>As second-class residents of a number of worlds, the Storks have no ancestral home world, leaving them mainly nomadic, resorting to a culture of piracy in the early days of the Federation, and to the present day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Storks have lived in the Bozotopia system for longer than the <a class="wikiLink" href="#coil">Coil</a> or <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> know. Back when the Coil and Bozo were still just leaves and peas, the Storks were predators. They ate them all right up. </p>
<p>However, as Bozo society developed, Storks took on a different role. The Bozo reproduce by asking a Bozo tree to sprout a seed and create a child. The Storks took on the task of delivering these children to the new parents, gliding down from their high perches above the Bozo trees. Predators-turned-nannies.</p>
<h2>Decline</h2>
<p>As technology has developed, Bozo reproduction has become more and more of a task. Historical distaste for Storks lead to technological developments that made their position in society redundant. Some traditional Storks still work in this role, but it's niche and rarely seen.</p>
<p>Storks, as a flying species, were among those who pioneered the first spacefaring technology. Without their help, it's uncertain whether the Bozo would have made it to space when they did.</p>
<p>However, the Stork situation is still a minor tragedy. They were an integral part of Bozo society for years, and this symbiotic partnership allowed both species to flourish. The march of technology made this dependency obsolete, and the Storks were the ones to suffer.</p>
<h2>Piracy</h2>
<p>The Bozo and the Storks worked together to develop their space faring technology, but when the Bozo took to space largely without them, a real bitterness took hold. </p>
<p>Many Stork turned to piracy, plundering Bozo vessels to take back their share. This caused a lot of friction during the early days of the Federation.</p>
<p>The Bozo fought back against the pirates, which made them unpopular among Storks on the Bozo home worlds, and from the <a class="wikiLink" href="#coil">Coil</a>, who share more liberally with their own Stork population.</p>
<p>Storks are known across the Federation for their tendency toward piracy. Their roots as caretakers are mainly forgotten among talks of the issues they cause for trade routes and stuff like that.</p>
<h3>The Baddies</h3>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_baddies">The Baddies</a> are a faction of criminal bounty hunters made up of many people from many species, although mainly bozo. They can be recognised by their characteristic mask. Pointed and tusked, pointedly aggressive.</p>
<p>Baddies join this club often not out of necessity, but for the thrill of piracy. Many of them come from well-esteemed families, playing at piracy for a while to ease a comfortable, bored existence.</p>
<p>This faction takes a particular interest in Storks, seeking them out for plunder more than anyone else, due to the group's historic roots as anti-pirate militia.</p>

<p>She is an amateur <a class="wikiLink" href="#hologram">holonovelist</a>, and authored the village of <a class="wikiLink" href="#westerfield">Westerfield</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#vinceprice_manor">Vinceprice Manor</a>, and the sentient holographic characters <a class="wikiLink" href="#witch">Witch</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#vod">Vod</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#donald_mackay">Donald Mackay</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#villain_king_piss">Villain King Piss</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#sherlock_holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#moriarty">Moriarty</a>.</p>
<h1>Childhood</h1>
<p>She was born on <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_small">Too Small</a> to a family wealthy in property but not much else, living in the mega sprawl of manor houses that weave around the sheer cliffs, dense jungles, and deep valleys of the planet's extreme terrain. </p>
<p>She lived far from the <a class="wikiLink" href="#skytree">Skytree</a>, and spent much of her childhood exploring the labyrinthine halls of her parents ancient estate. Not a lot happened there. It was mostly old rich people who wandered the halls. She read all the old tomes to death, seeing glimpses of life in them. Eventually she made the long journey through the manor network, through the squatters lands, to the fortress at the base of the Skytree, where she bought passage to <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_canopy">The Canopy</a>, and eventually <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a>. </p>
<p>It was her keen navigation skills that allowed her to escape the labyrinth of <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_small">Too Small</a>, and this is what won her her place on the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>. </p>
<h1>Career</h1>
<p>Teddie wanted to see everything the universe could offer, and she did. Too many times. Somewhere along the line, she stopped really caring about her original aims to explore space and write stories about it. She loved to make holodeck characters and settings and scenarios, but she never figured out how to commit to it. </p>
<p>She's frustrated, feeling stuck in her job, uninspired by her life, and burdened by the feeling that she's failed herself. She made promises to herself which she has not kept, because she never found the time and effort. She guards her breaks, and works on her creative efforts when she can.</p>
<h1>Children</h1>
<p>Teddie has several holographic children. Really she has hundreds, but only a few lapsed into sentience. They have expectations of her she cannot meet. She owes them a lot, but still feels she owes herself more.</p>
<p>The first was <a class="wikiLink" href="#vod">Vod</a>. A horrible monster turned bonafide sweetheart by an accident in <a class="wikiLink" href="#photonic_space">Photonic Space</a>, and some counselling from <a class="wikiLink" href="#bill">Bill</a>.</p>

He has genetic mange, which <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Humans</a> didn't anticipate could happen when they genetically modified dogs to be like people.</p>
<p>His coat is like straw. He gets it checked regularly, but his skin is falling apart. He signs up for an experimental treatment. They put a chip in his head that lets him control a robotic host remotely. As they adjust the chip in his head, he raises his hand to feel the skin where they planted it in his temple. </p>
<p>He sees the robot raise its hand, and feels no movement in his arm. He lowers his arm and looks at himself, like a scarecrow in a hospital chair, with a plug in his head. His skin like papier mache. </p>
<p>He watches through two cameras mounted behind glass eyes as they pack up his body for the automated medical shuttle he'll be stored on.</p>
<p>There, he will be cared for by the machine until a cure is found, transmitted to the shuttle, synthesised and administered. It seemed like an okay idea at the time.</p>
<p>Teto wakes up from his cryosleep. His hair is a lush black again, his skin is firm and healthy. It's ten quadrillion years later, and he is the only life left in the entire universe. He looks outside the shuttle into space, and it looks back at him from dense woods. As he runs his hand through his soft hair, his fingers find the button mounted to his skull and he presses down. </p>
<p>The doctors lift his body out of the room to the shuttle. He blinks. Two clicks resound in his head as the mechanism works for the first time.</p>
<p>"So, what's it like?" asks the scientist "The future I mean, you're connected, right?"
Teto responds: "<a class="wikiLink" href="#a_forest_full_of_demons">A Forest Full of Demons</a>"
"Bloody hell, that's a bit dramatic" says the scientist.
"Sorry"</p>
<p>Teto inspects his new robot body. Not bad, at least my hair looks nice now. He goes back to his job as a <a class="wikiLink" href="#dizbizazzle_bizzlebozzle_8">Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8</a> accountant, working remotely from the dead future, where only the remain, just to watch him die.

<div id="the_barket" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Barket</h2>
<p>The Barket is the black market within <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>. There is some confusion about the name, some believing it's a portmenteau of "Black Market", and some less-historically aware people thinking it has something to do with producing <a class="wikiLink" href="#dogs">Dogs</a>.</p>
<p>However, it's simple. It was originally The Bark Market, a network of pirates dens nestled in the bark of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#skytree">Skytrees</a> that make up <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_woods">The Woods</a> system. It started off in facilities dedicated to the extraction of <a class="wikiLink" href="#nectar">Nectar</a> from the Skytrees for synthesis of <a class="wikiLink" href="#dizbizazzle_bizzlebozzle_8">Dizbizazzle Bizzlebozzle 8</a>, the fuel used by spaceships. These facilities were numerous and are used as Barket dens. </p>
<p>The Barket is made up of many Federation species, and those outside of the Federation. However, it's mainly associated with <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork">Stork</a> piracy, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_baddies">Baddie</a> bounty hunters maintaining order. This is mainly rooted in old <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> prejudice against the Storks though.</p>
<p>The Barket exists wherever the hands of the Federation don't reach, or where disenfranchised members of the Federation meet, and gangs of those from outside the Federation, such as <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elves">The Elves</a>.</p>
<h2>The Elven Barket</h2>
<p>The Elven Barket is far removed from the Bark Market roots. When relations with the Elves loosened, and the Federation accepted Elves to visit, Elves with little prospects on their own worlds opted to instead find their fortune in the more socially fertile Federation. </p>
<p>Some of these Elves simply want to find a place to live a comfortable life without having to fight for it, and others want to use it to their advantage exactly because there is less fighting there. It's easy territory for those who are good at fighting, but aren't quite good enough to do it on their own planet, through legal means.</p>
<p>So places like <a class="wikiLink" href="#over_there">Over There</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a> have a lot of Elven Barket activity.</p>
<p>In fact the Elven Barket is so sweeping in this region of space that it's almost a faction in itself, but not quite yet.</p>
</div>

<div id="the_bloody_consortium" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Bloody Consortium</h2>
<p>The Bloody Consortium is a nightmare hellscape of torturous, hellish misery. They are awful. Every single one of them. Where members of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_cool_planets_club">The Cool Planets Club</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a> share member species between themselves, The Blood Consortium does not. If you're not a member of The Consortium, you're an enemy of The Consortium.</p>
<p>The Consortium come from <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_scab">The Scab</a>, a galaxy-scale anomaly that scars the universe from some ancient calamity. For millions of years, infection has spread from the wound in the form of hellish mutations. Every planet in it's orbit is changed and influenced by chaos. Nightmare beings travel from the open wound of The Scab and inhabit the planets on the other side. Alien species settled there have become warped and sinister.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>The Bloody Consortium was first established by <a class="wikiLink" href="#satanus">Satanus</a>, a planet-sized demi-god from the other side of the Scab. Whatever realm she came from, she brought with her hoards of beasts that crawled on the surface of her skin and populated the planets as she climbed into our realm.</p>
<p>As she climbed into our universe, she left her demons behind her, and left to parts unknown. She's presumably still out there, and many of the demons at work in The Consortium believe that she will return, and that their job is to destroy the neighbouring worlds. However, it's unsure whether she dispersed them on purpose, or if they were just like bacteria to her. When we spread germs, do we expect them to go to work on our behalf? I don't think so, but maybe she <em>was</em> just a demonic super spreader. </p>
<p>Satanus isn't necessarily bad; she maybe just didn't wash her hands before she went climbing through our universe.</p>
<h2>The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_royal_dominion_of_heavenly_bodies">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a> are banded together against the forces of The Bloody Consortium. </p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#life">Life</a>, in response to this existential threat, revised her policies on the afterlife. No longer would her subjects be held to one life only, she would give them a chance to live on as many times as possible. This would help slow the spread of the Consortium's infectious influence on the Galaxy by ensuring that the most talented of sentient species would be capable of living on and keeping the numbers up.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#future">Future</a> was created to manage timelines, and curate the process of events to manufacture a desirable conclusion to the existential war with the forces of the Consortium, while Life ensured that death could be avoided for the sentient beings who made up the counter force.</p>
<p>Demons are not bestowed with souls, and once destroyed cannot return to try again. However, they do procreate in the usual ways, and so they will persist.</p>
<h2>Inevitably, We Lose</h2>
<p>It's known by the Royal Dominion that the Bloody Consortium will inherit the universe one day, but their goal is to maintain life for as long as they can before the demons take over. At least, that's how it usually goes.</p>
<p>This is not the first time this has happened. There were Federations and Dominions and Conspiracies unknown numbers of years ago. Demons invaded then, and took over, and became isolated from one another in colonies which became the planets we known now; <a class="wikiLink" href="#earth">Earth</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#majoris_maximus">Majoris Maximus</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_woods">The Woods</a>, and so on. It all comes back around.</p>
<p>One day, the demons that infect the universe will develop into civilised societies of their own, and somewhere down the line, some new infection will spread.</p>
<h2>Our Only Hope, The Collective</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_collective">The Collective</a> is a eugenics cult started by <a class="wikiLink" href="#triple">Triple</a>-xenobiologist <a class="wikiLink" href="#brenda">Brenda</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#troll">Troll</a>-geneticist <a class="wikiLink" href="#hayley">Hayley</a> to reverse death. The project was hijacked by <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, in particular <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy#live">House Cuil</a>, working with forces and beings from <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_royal_dominion_of_heavenly_bodies">The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies</a>. They want to find out ways to create new life to fight the forces of the Bloody Consortium, and invest in enterprises that seek to solve this problem. </p>
<p>House Cuil were convinced to push this agenda by the Royal Dominion. The Royal Dominion don't care so much if House Cuil have their own selfish desires in creating soldiers, so long as they keep the Bloody Consortium down as they do it.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Collective</h2>
<p>The Collective is a science collective-turned-cult working on a disused moon in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a>.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>Founded by <a class="wikiLink" href="#brenda">Brenda</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#hayley">Hayley</a> to work on genetic engineering and cloning as a means to recreate or revive the dead, but turned sour by opportunistic parties. </p>
<p>The Collective found it's funding through <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. They used this funding to set up a base of operations inside of an old mining facility, and enlist the help of <a class="wikiLink" href="#grundo">Grundo</a>, a disgraced <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> scientist who was exiled from <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a> for his illegal work in genetics.</p>
<p>Matters soured as Brenda was influenced by the pure scientific ideals of Grundo, leading to Hayley's departure from the organisation to parts unknown.</p>
<p>Left to their own devices, Brenda and Grundo continued their research into their artificial lifeforms. They drifted from their original intent to necromancy to eugenics. </p>
<p>You could say it was a bad turn, but it's pretty rancid either way.</p>
<h2>A Change in Direction</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elves</a> decided to push their influence as the project took shape. They placed the Elf <a class="wikiLink" href="#laelithar">Laelithar</a> to oversee the project, to take their research and give it purpose and direction.</p>
<p>Laelithar invested time in hiring new staff to populate their growing Collective. Brenda saw this as a welcome growth of the family, but Grundo, a veteran of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>, saw it as Elven meddling, mistrustful of Laelithar's motives, and insulted by the excessively inclusive hiring policy.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#squeakella">Squeakella</a>, a <a class="wikiLink" href="#rat">Rat</a> was hired for security. <a class="wikiLink" href="#jockey">Jockey</a>, a <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork">Stork</a> was hired as a grafting and cloning specialist. Worst of all was <a class="wikiLink" href="#siana">Siana</a>, a <a class="wikiLink" href="#shitter">Shitter</a> hired to work directly alongside him. </p>
<p>All species in The Federation are embarrassed to be seen with Shitters. Too much giggling. They generally try to keep away from them, but The Elves had no such prejudice. In fact, the unfortunate naming was relatable to them.</p>
<p>Grundo couldn't stomach it, and departed from the Collective. He didn't make it, and at the request of Laelithar, he became the first piece of their ultimate aim: A new species comprising of all the greatest parts of all others. </p>
<p>I suppose it seemed like fun at the time.</p>
<h2>Loose Ends</h2>
<p>The Elves, in their speculative exploration of space, happened upon a strange species: <a class="wikiLink" href="#thread">The Thread</a>. Their reproductive biology was remarkable, a whole species cut from an endless <a class="wikiLink" href="#thread#the_spool">Spool</a>, a mass of sentient material woven into the fabric of their planet. What trick of nature allowed such a thing to exist?</p>
<p>Brenda and Squeakella travelled to the planet on orders of Laelithar to enlist a special recruit. Find one of these Thread people and bring them back for study. </p>
<p>Until now, The Collective had conducted experiments and research on its own members, who willingly gave themselves to testing on the understanding that it was for the good of their utopian goals of creating the ultimate species to unite them all. They didn't have great trope awareness.</p>
<p>A thread who agreed to leave the planet was found: <a class="wikiLink" href="#frayja">Frayja</a>. They were brought back to The Collective to a puzzled and intrigued reception. What a strange thing you are, they all thought. They were excited to have a new member of their family, and didn't see the sinister side of this kind of recruitment of less technologically developed species.</p>
<p>Siana made friends with and got to work on Frayja. She cloned, manipulated, and generally diced Frayja up, in search of their genetic secrets. The altered clones were sent out into space, and Frayja being a naive, friendly, and interesting alien, the people of the universe were happy to have them as a visitor without asking many questions.</p>
<p>The clones were sent on missions to gather intel from doctors, geneticists, anthropologists, bakers: anyone who would take an interest in a creature like Frayja would likely have research worth investigating for The Collective.</p>
<p>One of these clones was assigned to shadow <a class="wikiLink" href="#ihava_fullbody">Ihava Fullbody</a>, a <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Human</a> geneticist working on cellular regeneration. And that's all I have so far.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Cool Planets Club</h2>
<p>Being part of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> is cringe. Being in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_bloody_consortium">The Bloody Consortium</a> is less cringe, but still cringe. Generally, being in part of any species-based society is also a little bit cringe. You should just hang out somewhere cool and do cool stuff. The Cool Planets Club knows what's up.</p>
<p>The Cool Planets Club, also known as The Gang, is comprised not of species, but of planets; those outside of any other <a class="wikiLink" href="#list_of_galactic_political_cliques">Political Clique</a>, and those who want to distance themselves from the embarrassing sides of the Clique they belong to. </p>
<p>The Cool Planets Club engages more liberally in body modification, and have a league of superheroes called <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_alliance">The Alliance</a>.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>The Cool Planets Club was founded on <a class="wikiLink" href="#thasawrap">Thasawrap</a>, the wrap party planet, following the Federation conference held after <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>, where The Galactic Federation of Planets changed its name to The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets. After the infamous speech by <a class="wikiLink" href="#max_velocity">Max Velocity</a> where the word <em>Consenting</em> was added to their title.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's super sad what happened out there folks. I know, I was there. And no, I'm not proud of it, and I'm proud that I'm not, because that makes me humble. And humility is the name of the game out there, folks. </p>
<p>You don't know it 'til you've seen it. How small and humble we are in the face of the universe. It's beautiful, really. This is what you're missing by not being out with us, out there in the stars. But I didn't come here today to say that. Just shooting from the hip. But think about it. Okay.</p>
<p>We are a Federation bound to our ideals. Sometimes that means pushing the envelope, but can you blame us? Nothing ever got done without a little risk involved. Haven't we all at one time or another, got caught with our hand in the cookie jar? Do you know that expression. Those human movies they have. No? Nevermind.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is... I don't know what. But what can you say, really, in the face of the universe? It's terrible what happened It won't happen again. That's a Federation promise! No more invading. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armado leader <a class="wikiLink" href="#torquemada_amadeus">Torquemada Amadeus</a> was sooo embarrassed standing next to Max Velocity as he delivered his speech. And even more frustrated when the crowd cheered him on. The Federation is mainly run by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a>, and they were just so... Stupid. It's embarrassing.</p>
<p>Torquemada said as much to <a class="wikiLink" href="#ursavus_xi">Ursavus XI</a>, then-leader of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">The Big Surprise</a>, at the wrap party for the war. The Party Planets are spread throughout <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_neutral_bit">The Neutral Bit</a>, between the territories of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_bloody_consortium">The Bloody Consortium</a>.</p>
<p>Torquemada and Ursavus XI decided they should make a club. Not a political one, of course not. Just a secret club where politicians can get together and make plans without the influence of all the uncool and cringey species and planets. It's a little dodgy. But as long as you're cool, you can join. That was the idea.</p>
<h2>The Gang</h2>
<p>The Gang is the name the member planets of the Cool Planets Club use to refer to one another. <a class="wikiLink" href="#armadoniapolisvilletopia_iv">Armadoniapolisvilletopia IV</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_small">Too Small</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_party_planets">The Party Planets</a> were the first member planets. Later joined by <a class="wikiLink" href="#coil">Coil</a> homeworld, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_tether">The Tether</a>.</p>
<p>An offer to join was extended also to the Elven planet <a class="wikiLink" href="#riffindell">Riffindell</a>, seat <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy#laugh">House Lalaith</a>. The invitation was not formally rejected, but relations between House Lalaith and the gang are good. They meet up at room parties on the Party Planets sometimes and have a laugh together. They're sound.</p>
<p>The latest member planet to join the gang is <a class="wikiLink" href="#animalia">Animalia</a>, the planet gifted to the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uplifted_animal">Uplifted Animal</a> population after <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_humiliation">The Humiliation</a>. Animal people are generally cool.</p>
<h2>No Bozos</h2>
<p>The Cool Planets Club has a strict No Bozos policy. Bozos are cringe and embarrassing. <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a> took offence to the establishment of the club. The ego of the Bozo people was already bruised by the rejection of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a> to join the Federation, but bruised further by the establishment of The Cool Planets Club, especially because it was established by their own member species. In particular, the gang being co-founded by <a class="wikiLink" href="#ursavus_xi">Ursavus XI</a>, a descendant of Federation co-founder <a class="wikiLink" href="#ursavus">Ursavus</a>, caused a particular stir.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#blammo_bambano">Blammo Bambano</a>, descendant of famed explorer <a class="wikiLink" href="#blubberbox_bambano">Blubberbox Bambano</a>, and current head of intergalactic relations, is currently in talks with The Cool Planets Club to encourage their dissolution.</p>
<p>However, it's clear to the masses that a lot of the bitterness by The Federation is fuelled by the Bozos' damaged ego. As they push the issue, talk builds about the Federation's bias toward Bozo interests, which increases bitterness toward the Federation, and makes it seem somehow outdated, and cringe. Resistance to The Cool Planets Club causes increased bitterness toward the Federation.</p>
<h2>The "Cool Mob"</h2>
<p>A lot of people, Bozo or otherwise, recognise that The Cool Planets Club is a bit petty and mean, though. There is a culture war within the Federation over people who appear "too cool" for good, honest Federation citizens. Coolness in The Federation is therefore much more overblown and silly, intentionally embarrassing and camp to counteract any suggestion that they are too aloof. The brand of coolness associated with The Cool Planets Club is seen as overly intellectual, and separated from the interests of common people. </p>
<h2>Relationship with The Baddies</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_baddies">The Baddies</a> are a gang of upper-middle class pirates, started in response to <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork">Stork</a> pirate culture after the founding of the Federation. They've been around for a long time. Condemned by the Federation, but tolerated more readily than Stork pirates. This is because many members of The Baddies are rich kids from Federation planets playing vigilante despite their parents' wishes. They're so tied up with the social hierarchy of the Federation itself that it would politically unsound to risk killing and subjugating them.</p>
<p>The Baddies try so hard to be cool. They didn't want to be cringe Federation officers, and have been trying for years to avoid becoming embarrassing or uncool. When The Cool Planets Club was established, The Baddies showed up to a lot of their parties and tried to make connections. They began to cling onto everything The Cool Planets Club did, setting up bases around their planets and unofficially aligning themselves with The Club to win favour with them.</p>
<p>This in itself is cringe, and The Cool Planets Club resent this unrequested alliance. It makes them look bad, too; they don't want to work with pirates. And if they did want to work with pirates, they'd work with the Stork, because the Stork were <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork#history">screwed over by the Bozo</a>. The presence of The Baddies in their space makes it unappealing for Stork pirates to visit, which The Club would actually like.</p>
<p>The Baddies are just rich kids having fun playing pirates, thinking they're cool because they're successful at it, despite the fact that they only get away with it because their parents are in positions of power holding back Federation forces from wiping them out.</p>

<div id="the_elven_conspiracy" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Elven Conspiracy</h2>
<p>The Elven Conspiracy is a recently-formed <a class="wikiLink" href="#list_of_galactic_unions">Galactic Union</a> arranged by <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">The Elves</a>, also involving <a class="wikiLink" href="#rat">the Rats</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#troll">the Trolls</a>. </p>
<h2>It's a bit on the nose, isn't it?</h2>
<p>Wanting to differentiate themselves from the other Galactic Unions with a unique collective noun, and not knowing the implications of the word <em>Conspiracy</em>, they unwittingly made themselves look incredibly suspicious. </p>
<p>Although it <em>is</em> true that they are underhanded, shady, and conniving, that's not unique to them. At least <em>The Conspiracy</em>, as it's often called, isn't corrupt.</p>
<p>An effect of having a name which inspires distrust is that, in order to do all the dodgy things that all governments end up doing, you have to be a bit more clever than that.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">The Elves</a> were an independent species group, tucked in their private corner of space, mulling over their cosmic secrets.</p>
<p>As they ventured into space, they found a sinister force at work in their galaxy; <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Planets</a>. The GFOP, recognising the powers of the Elves, tried to bring them into their Federation, but the Elves refused. This lead to <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>, a war to subjugate the Elves and bring them under control.</p>
<p>The Federation had never met an intelligent species that didn't want to join their club, or at least be friends. And this species was cool. Really cool. They had something like Magic. The Federation wanted it, and decided to Dabble. Dabble in a little bit of war and colonisation.</p>
<p>But it failed, and The Federation was forced to stand down their force. In their failure, they adapted their name to The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets, to ensure this sort of thing didn't happen again.</p>
<p>The Elves, as a result, formed a counter Clique to push back against The Federation and further outside influence. The Elven Conspiracy was formed. <a class="wikiLink" href="#rat">The Rats</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#troll">The Trolls</a> joined, as they had long trade relations with the Elves in some colonies of their galaxy-wide societies.</p>
<h2>The House of Lords</h2>
<p>The House of Lords are the old collection of families that have headed Elven society in their realm of space for thousands of years. Until recently they have been happy to occupy their space in privacy, and grow old and strange in that privacy.</p>
<p>It started democratically. Elves fought for influence over their society, and some of them did better than others. The rewards of those victories trickled down into their immediate families as education and material wealth. As the rewards built at their feet, their descendants climbed higher and higher in society.</p>
<p>They ran for office off the backs of their wealth and education. They took over the home planets of the Elves and fought for land. Those who fought best won the most, and these families grew as the wealth piled up, shared from one to the next to the next.</p>
<p>At one time, an Elf of no background might spring up from the peasantry, take a political seat, and reap the benefits of that position. Then they would pass it down to their children, and those children simply became part of the system those upstart Elves had sought to overthrow.</p>
<p>Over the years, this developed into a deeply entrenched class system, where by birthright some Elves saw it as their divine right to rule. They learned the ways of ruling, studied and perfected them, and taught them to their children. The ways of wealth and ownership and leadership and political conquest.</p>
<p>The race to the top of the chain continued for centuries, until the social ladder became unscalable for anyone on the lower rungs of society. All that remained to maintain social position was to kick down and keep your own place.</p>
<p>The descendants of those early conquerors and entrepreneurs became wealthy and powerful Lords, with family history in ruling that stretched out longer than any history in industry or craft. They were the ruling class, and as the centuries and millennia marched on, their families grew into houses, and those houses found new worlds to conquer. They build grand cities that became old cities. Mega structures built on layers of old settlements built on barren worlds transformed by terraforming technologies. Impossibly old.</p>
<p>The leadership of overall Elven society was once democratically elected, but eventually the leadership was simply passed between the descendants of each ruling house, as they moved in and out of favour. They all knew one another, and they all scrapped with each other in their political playground, vying for power for the good of their house. </p>
<p>Once the Three Houses had been established and pulled ahead of the rest in their power and influence, leadership essentially passed between the three. Different internal branches of each house may have taken the lead at different times, but it all moved within the The Houses.</p>
<h2>The Three Houses</h2>
<p>The ruling classes of Elven society are mainly comprised of <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf#posh_elf">Posh Elves</a>, with the places in each house for <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf#war_elf">War Elves</a>, and sometimes <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf#yoga_elf">Yoga Elves</a>, although this is rare and seen as particularly bad practice. These Elves have big hands, and it's generally sought after that an Elf of high regard has big hands. The bigger the hands, the more secrets you can hold in your fist, as they say.</p>
<p>The Three Houses are House Cuil, House Lalaith, and House Mel, Houses that fashion themselves after The Three Spirits; Life, Laughter, and Love. Despite simply being long-standing political families, they have adopted a sort of Godly status in Elven society. The leaders of each House have powers beyond that of regular Elves, and are known to have communed with entities from other realms and realities. Whether this is just a result of wealth and technology over thousands of years, it doesn't matter so much anymore. They have their Godlike power now, and nobody can take them down through politics alone.</p>
<h3>Live</h3>
<p>House Cuil is the house of Life. They have always desired freedom of body and spirit. However, their desire is selfish. They believe in the freedom of the individual despite what that freedom entails for others. Freedom to conquer and enslave, freedom to seek wealth and power at the expense of others. They are hoarders, warmongers, jealous and unreasonable. They are often undone by infighting, as their ideals of individuality are at odds with the strength they have only because of their family bonds.</p>
<p>House Cuil is therefore a smaller house, but nonetheless powerful. The individual conquests of it's members gives them great influence, but infighting means that their ranks don't grow to the same scale as the other houses.</p>
<h3>Laugh</h3>
<p>House Lalaith is the house of Laughter. They believe in the benefits of camaraderie, and growth through healthy competition. They're not necessarily kind to one another, however. They want above all else to have the last laugh. Whether a laugh is shared or at the expense of another doesn't necessarily matter. </p>
<p>They are good humoured, but are vengeful against those who laugh at their expense. A non-mutual laugh is an insult to those who follow House Lalaith, and so they are encouraged to be candid, open, and keep no secrets from one another. Everyone must be in on the joke, or conflicts will inevitably arise. As such, they are very honourable within their own house</p>
<h3>Love</h3>
<p>House Mel is the house of Love. They are much more socially democratic, allowing for upward mobility in their ranks, and extending offers of power and influence to commonfolk from time to time. Commonfolk on planets with the influence of House Mel enjoy greater community bonds through their whole society. The division in class is not so stark, with high-ranking members of the house comfortably walking in the cities among the people. Social enterprises patch up gaps in government funding, and there is a great deal of trust.</p>
<p>The leaders of house Mel have historically believed in the importance of maintaining the promise of social mobility as a method of fostering trust in their society. Everyone trusts one another more, and extends kindness where they can, believing that the system will reward their generosity in some way.</p>
<p>House Mel is not ideal however, the appearance of social mobility is gatekept as to stagger the progress of anyone who attempts to climb the social ladder. </p>
<p>The highest stations in their society are still populated by old families. Even with their society working nicely, these old families can't truly trust their society to uphold their ancient ideals. And so they cling to power. They call it Love for their society when they weed out Elves who want to increase their share of power too quickly, and are suspicious of social climbers. </p>
<p>As they see it, social mobility is important for the health of their society, but must be made slowly over generations, or else they run the risk of allowing high-level influence from those who haven't been moulded by the establishment over generations of exposure to the higher-class social structure.</p>
<p>They are welcoming to Yoga Elves, where the other two houses shun and fear them. They work with War Elves as equals, appreciating their expertise in war, and respecting their mental boundaries.</p>
<h2>Class, War &amp; Infighting</h2>
<p>Elven society operates on many metasocial layers. On the top level there are the immortals, those that walk with the forces of nature using their genetic and technological enhancements. Their manners are impossibly complex. They don't even know about the wars with or on their planet. They are the leaders of their houses, looking for new ground in higher dimensions to get the upper hand on one another.</p>
<p>Lower in society, deep beneath the most powerful people in their society, there are kings and prime ministers and lords. Schemers seeking to be the best within their current class, hoping to advance into the next rung of society. Maybe one day their children will meet the people and have the influence necessary to have even a scrap of the genetic enhancements the real Gods of their society have. Maybe they will be immortal.</p>
<p>But they're not, for now. They live like the rest of civilised life in the Federation.</p>
<p>And below them still are the lesser Elves; Goblins and Orcs who inhabit spaces with even lower forms of technology. Elves have somehow managed to segregate their entire society from neanderthals to Gods. They are all one species, but they are billions of years apart.</p>
<p>The Kings think nothing of the infighting of the clans, as the Gods feel nothing for the squabbles in 5th dimensional space, and the hypersphere Elves don't think much of the Kings.</p>

<p>Within each house there are tiers of society all the way down to the mudrunners and the golems and the war elves and the posh elves and the wildcards like the yoga elves. There's more kinds of elf than there are species in the federation. They are the single most dominant species in terms of population when tracing common genetic heritage, but they're isolated to their own small region of space.</p>
<p>Every possible mutation and adaptation has been made. The cave elves, the iron working elves, the fighting elves, the psychic elves, the posh elves, the humble elves, every single kind of niche you can think of, there's an elf for it, and they all have impressions of all the others that determine how they interact. The layers of manners and sociopolitical tact is infinite.</p>
<p>Any elf will ask first the class and house of another elf, if it's not clear from their physiology. They come in every race, like humans.</p>

<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>The origins of the Federation go back to before space flight, in the industrial ages of its member planets. As soon as planets could send messages into space, they were talking to one another. This communication network was called <a class="wikiLink" href="#spacenet">SpaceNet</a>, and the species of the Federation spoke to one another across space for hundreds of years before their eventual meeting on <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a>, with the pivotal help of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#stork">Stork</a>, were the first to achieve long distance space travel, and founded the Federation capital on the <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">Bear</a> planet <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a> in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_woods">The Woods</a>.</p>
<h1>Major Events</h1>
<h2>The Humiliation</h2>
<h2>The Dabbling</h2>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a> humbled The Federation when they were forced to cease an invasion against <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">The Elves</a> by superior might and public outcry. Since then, there's been a stink in the air about upper leadership. </p>
<h2>Erosion</h2>
<p>The Galactic Federation of Planets became The Galactic Federation of <em>Consenting</em> Planets after the Dabbling. <a class="wikiLink" href="#max_velocity">Max Velocity</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> war hero and all around fun times guy, had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's super sad what happened out there folks. I know, I was there. And no, I'm not proud of it, and I'm proud that I'm not, because that makes me humble. And humility is the name of the game out there, folks. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>This rousing speech was given the day the Elven Quarter was opened on <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a>. The Elves mainly refuse to use this gifted colony, although some recognise the benefits of Federation society and opt to stay there, while relations between The Federation and The Conspiracy continue to coast along without incident, while they engage in their secret culture war. </p>
<p>The Federation continues to beckon the Elf population to the side of guaranteed housing and self-sufficiency with no social mobility, while the The Conspiracy works the fringes of Federation space with the allure of <a class="wikiLink" href="#money">Money</a>, and its power over people.</p>

<div id="the_humiliation" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Humiliation</h2>
<p>The Humiliation is the period of <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Human</a> history following on from the destruction of <a class="wikiLink" href="#earth">Earth</a> involving the creation of <a class="wikiLink" href="#uplifted_animal">Uplifted Animal</a>, the destruction of most human colonies on <a class="wikiLink" href="#mars">Mars</a>, and ultimately leading to the human race joining <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>.</p>
<p>The human race, following the destruction of Earth by nuclear war, fell into a period of existential loneliness, feeling utterly alone in the universe with no promise of alien life to lift them out of their situation. </p>
<p>On the edge of extinction living in their flawed and oppressive Mars colonies, the few humans left longed for the comforts of Earth. Green grass, a dog to walk, a petting zoo, all of the funny little creatures now extinct by their catastrophic failure to preserve their planet.</p>
<p>Pulling from their genetic archives, the humans sought to create a kind of alien life for themselves, creating animal/human hybrids to give some colour to their dulling existence.</p>
<p>The GFOCP, surveying the humans' progress, decided to swoop in at this point to have a word with humans about their conduct. </p>
<p>Overjoyed, the humans set aside their uplifted animal production process and begged for a position in the Federation. A request ultimately refused, so long as the human race continued to be haphazard in its ethical ideals.</p>
<p>What followed from this rejection was further nuclear devastation as the remaining colonies on Mars disagreed on their response to the new Federation. This war destroyed most of what was left of mankind, leaving few colonies left. </p>
<p>Pitying their quarrelsome nature and recognising their reckless optimism about human nature, the Federation extended their help to the humans to rebuild their remaining colonies, and invite them into their Federation officially, despite their continued production of uplifted animals.</p>
<p>Most of mankind fled toward more populated regions of space, leaving few behind in the upgraded colonies. The GFOCP, recognising their incompetent handling of the event, gave the uplifted animal population their own planetary system of freshly terraformed planets, named the <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_pity_planets">The Pity Planets</a> system.</p>

<p>The Party Planets are planets between space occupied by <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>. <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_cool_planets_club">The Cool Planets Club</a> was founded on <a class="wikiLink" href="#thasawrap">Thasawrap</a>.</p>
<p>This region was formed as a diplomatically neutral point between The Elves and The Federation. As such, it is relatively lawless. It governs itself, with the help of Federation and Elven influences, but mainly controlled by forces within <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_barket">The Barket</a>.</p>
<p>Light in this region of space is confusing, often just wrong. Whole planets go without sun for months, despite being in clear view of the sun. It sometimes simply doesn't land. The light gets lost on its way to the surface. No one has figured this out, but some believe that <a class="wikiLink" href="#photonic_space">Photonic Space</a> may be siphoning off solar power to their position on the far edge of <a class="wikiLink" href="#over_there">Over There</a>, in the heart of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_void">The Void</a>.</p>
<h1>Before the Party</h1>
<p>Before they were discovered and colonised by The Federation, The Party Planets were in communication with one another. Entities and ethereal species lurked in the darkness of these planets.</p>
<p>From this vantage point, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a> first met and talked with <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, in talks that would lead to The Federation declaring war against The Elves, known as <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>. </p>
<p>The Party Planets, not then known by any particular name, remained unclaimed. The <a class="wikiLink" href="#grue">Grue</a> hid away in their void dimensions tucked into the dark corners still left, while the truly formless entities fought back against light. Some entities used sound and psychic powers to lure the invaders into the darkness to spirit them away, but this only half worked.</p>
<p>The forces at work in the dark knew how to lure people,  but not much of how to occupy them after that. Typically the would try to assume control over their victims and use them as puppets. They learned from their efforts how to enter the mind of the invading species, but never to control it. However, they got a taste for it nonetheless, and began seeking alien minds to piggyback off of. Humanoid feelings are such a rush!</p>
<p>The darkness got hooked on possession, a shift in its collective consciousness that so overwhelmed their nature that the darkness entities essentially became one mind, dedicated to maximising the comfort of their alien hosts. Now and then they would take the mind of someone in pain, and it sucked. This fighting had to stop, it was harshing the vibes of their hosts, and so the Darkness, as they call it, pushed further into their hosts minds to inhibit their will to fight while on these planets. </p>
<p>There developed an odd culture in these planets that became known during the last days of the war. The planets made people peaceful. Rowdy and reckless, but non-violent. It was like everyone who landed there felt emboldened by a peaceful spirit with a drive to have fun.</p>
<p>When the Elves had their decisive victory, pushing the Federation back into their own space, The Party Planets were chosen as the grounds for the final peace treaties to be signed off on, for its reputation as a calming place.</p>
<h2>Now</h2>
<p>The Party Planets were developed. They became party destinations and health retreats. The inhabitants have learned the quirks of the Darkness, and have studied it extensively. They're chill about it, although a lot of people who haven't visited think they sound brainwashed. Sure, a spirit of darkness crawls into the shadows and darkness inside of the body of everyone who visits, but it's also totally chill. Why would anyone be worried about something silly like being possessed by darkness itself?</p>
<p>Those who stay too long risk losing their mind entirely to the Darkness, which slowly exerts it's influence on minds until their control is absolute. No big deal though, just get to a light room for a detox. About 12 hours in a well lit room and you'll be cleaned up.</p>
<p>When the light returns, a depression washes through the populace as the Darkness retreats, and it's celebrated on its return.</p>

<p>The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies are a <a class="wikiLink" href="#list_of_galactic_political_cliques">Galactic Political Clique</a> founded by divine intervention. They are the oldest known GPC, and only accept the term to be polite. They are also lesser players in the political intrigue of higher realms, somewhere where the higher ranks of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a> are hard at work. </p>
<p>All designs begun in this universe are the games of some middle managers from a higher dimension.</p>
<p>They are generally amicable and resist war. They're all-powerful, and if anyone has tried to take them on, there is no history of it.</p>
<p>Of the species and beings who are members of the Dominion, the <a class="wikiLink" href="#seer">Seer</a> are the most prominent in <a class="wikiLink" href="#federation_space">Federation Space</a>, acting as psychics for <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>. </p>
<p>There are also some <a class="wikiLink" href="#rat">Rat</a> species who find themselves included in the Clique. Those with ascended qualities like telekinetic and psychic abilities similar to Seers and <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">Elves</a>.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">Elves</a> don't count themselves as part of the Dominion, although the Dominion would happily have them. The Elves are an old species, about which little is known. They resist involvement in Cliques for unknown reasons. It seems like they might just prefer to work on their own internal politics, although they do ally with some <a class="wikiLink" href="#rat">Rat</a> species and <a class="wikiLink" href="#troll">Trolls</a>, who have shared their region of space for long enough to be similar culturally.</p>

<p>S (pronounced "ess") is the snake god of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#snerson">Sneeple</a>, and namesake of their homeworld, <a class="wikiLink" href="#s_(planet)">S (Planet)</a></p>
<p>Many thousands of years ago, The Peel, an unravelled planet, reached out across space and latched onto the Snerson homeworld, with many believing it to be the mouth of a galactic snake injecting the venom of wisdom into their planet, thus exhausting it's life force and bestowing it upon their planet. </p>
<p>They named their planet after this galactic snake, and maintain the name until the present day.</p>
<p>As the Sneeple improved their scientific knowledge, they ventured up the husk of the galactic snake, and discovered the <a class="wikiLink" href="#roundoid">Roundoids</a> living upon it. </p>
<p>The Roundoids told them that the snake was in fact a planet that had unravelled after excessive fracking, and had collided with their planet.</p>
<p>The Sneeple, insulted by this idea, believed the Roundoids to be servants of The Orb, the spiritual rival of S. </p>
<p>Out of spite for the Sneeples' superstition, the Roundoids decided to follow The Orb and engaged in war against the Sneeple. </p>
<p>The war raged on for so long that the Roindoids came to believe that they were fact were the destined rivals of the Sneeple, followers of their god, The Orb.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a>, the war gradually cooled down, as the Bozo shared their technology and rubbed it in their face that the snake really was just an unravelled planet; a fact long-forgotten by both the Sneeple and the Roundoids.</p>
<p>Both the Sneeple and the Roundoids put aside their war out of embarrassment, and joined the Bozo's newly founded <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">The Woods</h2>
<p>The Woods is home to <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">The Big Surprise</a>, and named for the Skytree network that connects its three main bodies: <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_small">Too Small</a> and the capital planet <a class="wikiLink" href="#just_right">Just Right</a>. The Woods orbits far outside of <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozotopia">The Bozotopia System</a>. </p>
<p>The continental leaves of the Skytree bathe the planets' surfaces with a green-tinted darkness, and so the Bears who have settled here live within the Skytree itself, in dense subterranean root systems and trunk interiors so vast that they hold their own unique atmospheres and gravitational forces.</p>
<h2>The Big Surprise</h2>
<p>The Big Surprise is the collective term for all of Bear society, coined by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">Bozo</a> explorers when they unexpectedly found a thriving technological civilization inside of the tree on the outside of their star system.</p>
<p>Famed Bozo explorer <a class="wikiLink" href="#blubberbox_bambano">Blubberbox Bambano</a> was the first to meet with the Bear people, and their then leader <a class="wikiLink" href="#ursavus">Ursavus</a>. They got on like a house on fire, whatever that means.</p>
<h2>Gateway to the Stars</h2>
<p>The Bozo and Bears traded for hundreds of years. Sent envoys to one another and maintained strong relations. They've never ever had any trouble. </p>
<p>This relationship forms the foundation of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a>, as the Bears allowed the Bozo to use <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a> as a base of operations for their exploration into deeper space.

    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Thing</h2>
<p>Throughout space there are many aligned and unaligned species that make their moves in factions or mind their own business. Then there are Things. Things are just individuals with no clear lineage, or with biology unique enough that they don't fit into any broad group. </p>
<p>There are classifications to help keep track of all the Things running around in the universe. If a Thing can reproduce, and creates a race of species as a result, they take on a new classification and are no longer an anonymous Thing.
- Anomaly - Things that are known to have been made as a result of some kind of scientific mishap.
- Nomads - Things with no clear origin. Presumably descended from something, but that something isn't known.
- Divergents - Things that have knowingly diverged from their own species through enhancements and conscious evolutionary choices.
- Hand Wave - I don't know!</p>

<p>Tic Tac Toe is some kind of transported anomaly serving as a Gossip on board the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>While transporting <a class="wikiLink" href="#edosi">Edosi</a> back from an away mission, a mouthless but nevertheless talkative alien appeared in his place. When the transportation was retried, more of the same alien appeared, until there were three of them there, talking to one another.

<p>Because they were in a rush to get <a class="wikiLink" href="#edosi">Edosi</a> back from his mission, they overlooked the appearance of Tic Tac Toe and they've just been part of the furniture ever since.</p>
<p>They don't have any remarkable skills, but their commentary and companionship is welcomed. And sometimes they say accidentally helpful things. They were given the honorary role of gossip, acting as an informal PA system that can be relied on to relay information throughout the crew. They don't always have the best social tact, but they keep things interesting.</p>

<div id="too_big" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Too Big</h2>
<p>Too Big is the largest of the three planets that form the base of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_woods">The Woods</a>, alongside <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_small">Too Small</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#just_right">Just Right</a>. It is owned by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">The Bears</a>, but run by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bozo">The Bozo</a> as a diplomatic base for <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a>.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Too Big, being the largest of the three planets, has the most space on its surface. It has few mountains, sparse foliage, and it's atmosphere is stretched too thin to comfortably settled.</p>
<p>As a result, it was mostly ignored by the Bears for much of their history.</p>
<p>However, as relations with the Bozo grew, Too Big was increasingly developed with terraforming technology as a diplomatic centre for the Bozos' newly formed Federation. </p>
<h3>Metropolis</h3>
<p>As the Federation grew, more and more of Too Big was set aside for colonies and communities for other Federation members, spanning across the planet's mostly flat surface. Above all, the trunk of the Skytree loom, now glowing with a million lights like a big Christmas tree, illuminating the city below.</p>
<p>The planet began to develop into something of a cultural centre for the whole Federation as more and more cultures set down roots there. Even some non Federation worlds developed communities on the surface of the planet, although under careful supervision.</p>
<p>As a result of this growing importance, Too Big has been involved in many of the major Federation events.</p>
<h3>The Humiliation</h3>
<p>The first major diplomatic upset for The Federation, <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_humiliation">The Humiliation</a> was the unstable and risky inclusion of <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">Humans</a> and their <a class="wikiLink" href="#uplifted_animal">Uplifted Animal</a> genetically modified subspecies to The Federation. </p>
<p>Too Big opened up areas of the planet to house the Animal population, but controversially didn't extend this same courtesy to Humans, for fear of their instability and persisting love for weapons.</p>
<p>Humans instead were taken as refugees into various colonies across the planet, where they grew again in number and established themselves as an obnoxiously persistent presence in every society.</p>
<h3>The Dabbling</h3>
<p>After the discovery of <a class="wikiLink" href="#elf">Elves</a> in deep space, The Federation embarked on a war to subjugate and take the Elves into their Federation. This poorly considered act became known as <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_dabbling">The Dabbling</a>, and resulted in the establishment of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_elven_conspiracy">The Elven Conspiracy</a>, and the addition of the word <em>Consenting</em> to <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a>.</p>
<p>Too Big was thankfully left out of this war, with military might stored elsewhere in Bozotopia to keep Too Big safe from being targeted for retaliation.</p>
<p>There were protests. The many peoples of the planet disagreed with the invasion of the Elven worlds, and this pressure, as well as the Elves forces, compelled the Federation to cease their invasion. Most people were frankly annoyed that the Federation had forgotten that war is generally considered to be a no-no.</p>
<p>The Elves were allowed to settle on Too Big as a gesture of apology. Not many of them moved to these settlements, however.</p>
<h2>Present Day</h2>
<p>Too Big remains an important cultural and diplomatic centre for The Federation, but as it grows, and mistakes and disasters mark the Federation's reputation, the populace becomes increasingly divided </p>
<p>Still great for a night out though.</p>

<div id="too_small" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Too Small</h2>
<p>Too Small is the smallest of the three planets that form the base of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_woods">The Woods</a>, alongside <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#just_right">Just Right</a>. It is owned by <a class="wikiLink" href="#bear">The Bears</a>, but is mostly ignored.</p>
<p>Small is a planet of extremes where it's said that lightning always strikes twice. Colossal mountains strike at the thick atmosphere, and deep oceans push down on the thin roots of its Skytree.</p>
<p>It's unknown how populated the planet is on account of its dense sprawl of manor houses, developed over thousands of years by old families living on the surface until it resulted in labyrinth of endless corridors.</p>
<h1>Manor Sprawl</h1>
<p>Too Small's extreme geography is woven with manor houses and architecture of huge variety, dense and endless, and very old. It's full of wonders and treasures which draw in adventurers, but few of them who go too deep can leave.</p>
<p>It's a slum, a rich slum full of rich people, who are lost and very far from civilization. Its extreme weather makes it impossible to approach by any kind of aerial shuttle, the only method of traversing it is through its network of manor houses and facilities. But as the sprawl expanded and condensed, the ways got obscured, and many people got lost in the halls. Few escape.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#teddie">Teddie</a>, full name Teddie Bear, is from one of these old families, and grew up in the Sprawl.</p>

<div id="triple" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Triple</h2>
<p>The Trip of Triples are a member species of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> from the <a class="wikiLink" href="#triad">Triad</a>, a trio of planets called <a class="wikiLink" href="#planet_i">Planet I</a>, <a class="wikiLink" href="#planet_ii">Planet II</a>, and <a class="wikiLink" href="#planet_iii">Planet III</a></p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Triples have three legs. Sometimes biology makes mistakes. Triples are named for their tendency to trip, although most believe that they're named for their three legs. Related, but not quite right.</p>
<p>Triples spend much of their life doing their best to train their coordination to deal with having three legs. Learning to walk takes a lot longer for Triples, because there's more to consider than for bipedal species. As such, their young require longer-term care. Triples' cognitive development outpaces their motor skill development, as they spend a lot of time staring at the ceiling as babies, learning to do as much as they can with their hands, making them quite dexterous and introspective.</p>
<p>Essentially, talking is all that Triple babies can preoccupy themselves with. And with their naturally fast-thinking brains, they make fast progress on this front during early development.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for Triples to learn how to speak before they can walk, and they are adept talkers. It's said that Triples developed their ability to chatter as a survival tactic, talking their way out of arguments with other babies, and out of fights with predators. </p>
<h2>Federation Membership</h2>
<p>The Trip fell into <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Federation</a> shortly before their official unification with the establishment of <a class="wikiLink" href="#too_big">Too Big</a> as their capital planet.</p>
<p>Triples were the most active members of <a class="wikiLink" href="#spacenet">SpaceNet</a> in the centuries leading up to the establishment of the Federation. However, they were <em>so</em> chatty that their impact dominated the channels they engaged with, and a lot of the time they were talking between themselves as a result. Their late addition to the Federation clique is a result of their being largely ignored online, as their dominating conversational style was difficult for other species to keep up with.</p>

<p>Uplifted animals (aka Animal People) are an <a class="wikiLink" href="#unaffiliated">unaffiliated</a> species created by <a class="wikiLink" href="#human">humans</a>, and inhabiting <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_pity_planets">The Pity Planets</a>.</p>
<p>They are a sub-species of human, created artificially before the arrival of alien life to human-occupied <a class="wikiLink" href="#mars">Mars</a> (see: <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_humiliation">The Humiliation</a>)</p>
<p>Although they were offered a place in <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets</a> following their gift of the Pity Planets, the Animals made the decision to establish their society before committing to any further political affiliations. They receive support from the GFOCP, and have been steadily developing their society and culture since they were established 100 years ago.</p>

<div id="vod" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Vod</h2>
<p>Vod is a <a class="wikiLink" href="#thing">Thing</a> of some sort, serving as first commander of the <a class="wikiLink" href="#uss_voyeur">USS Voyeur</a>.</p>
<p>He was created by <a class="wikiLink" href="#teddie">Teddie</a> as a <a class="wikiLink" href="#hologram">Hologram</a> before attaining sentience during an incident in <a class="wikiLink" href="#photonic_space">Photonic Space</a>. Since then he has been a non-specific biological entity with full autonomy as a member of <a class="wikiLink" href="#the_galactic_federation_of_consenting_planets">the Federation</a>. He has a romantic relationship with <a class="wikiLink" href="#bill">Bill</a>.</p>
<h2>The Vampire of Vinceprice Manor</h2>
<p>Vod was the Vampire of <a class="wikiLink" href="#vinceprice_manor">Vinceprice Manor</a> on the outskirts of <a class="wikiLink" href="#westerfield">Westerfield</a>. He wiled away his days planning out schemes to lure the townsfolk into his thrall. His greatest nemesis was <a class="wikiLink" href="#admiral_dog">Dan Doggett</a>, a marshall of Westerfield and then-first commander of the Voyeur.</p>
<h2>Photonic Space</h2>
<p>During an expedition into <a class="wikiLink" href="#photonic_space">Photonic Space</a>, Photonic beings, unfamiliar with the ship and it's technology, attempted to resolve the conflict between the Holodeck on board the ship and the physical ship itself. </p>
<p>Believing the ship to be an anomaly attached to a normal photonic world, they began trying to convert every being on board into Photonics. <a class="wikiLink" href="#edosi">Edosi</a> pushed back until they realised their error and the Voyeur and the Photonics agreed to part ways. The Photonics converted all crew members back and the Voyeur left Photonic Space.</p>
<p>However, during all of this, the Vampire of Vinceprice Manor was in battle with Dan Doggett. As the Photonics took notice of the ship and began their conversion, their battle was interrupted by visiting Photonics. The Vampire, seizing the opportunity, attempted to enthrall them. This provoked matters, and so Dan Doggett joined with the Photonics to keep the Vampire at bay while the divide between their worlds was thin.</p>
<p>They held him off and eventually subdued him in his manor where they locked him away until the event concluded.</p>
<h2>Bloodthirsty Murderer</h2>
<p>Westerfield was at peace, and the barrier between holograms and biologics was solid again. </p>
<p>Each time the Vampire is subdued in his coffin, he takes some time to regenerate, until the coffin is opened again, and he is prompted to rise from his slumber. Life goes on.</p>
<p>In the night, he rose to weave his schemes. He descended into the village to feast.</p>
<p>In the morning, Commander Dog donned his vampire hunting gear and made his way to Westerfield. The atmosphere was different. At the scene of the crime, the ferrous stench of blood was sharper, and the corpses of the villagers had aged differently. More gruesome. The sense of realism was too much. He scanned the blood. Real. He checked the holomatrix for records of these entities. No records. Finally he called the doctor. They were biological, and now they're dead. The Vampire had killed them.</p>
<p>Holograms cannot kill people. There are too many safeguards. Checks on their systems confirmed the suspicion: the Photonics hadn't stopped at correcting their conversions; they had turned the Holograms biological too.</p>
<p>The Vampire sat on his high seat in his manor, picking his teeth. Bones lay at his feet and the air was dark.</p>
<p>In a final confrontation with Dan Doggett, Commander Dog, the Vampire was subdued and taken into custody for further study.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#captain">Captain</a> and <a class="wikiLink" href="#admiral_dog">Commander Dog</a> argued over what to do with him. With assistance from <a class="wikiLink" href="#bill">Bill</a> the <a class="wikiLink" href="#seer">Seer</a>, the Vampire was reformed, and Captain allowed him a place in the crew. Dog disagreed with this wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>The holodeck was closed off, and the holographic villagers regenerated from backups. No one has to know.</p>
<h2>One of the Family</h2>
<p>He chose the name Vod and became an Ensign, quickly proving that the thousands of years of life experience he had automatically generated as a hologram were useful as an officer. His origins were hidden from most of the crew, and from the Federation. </p>
<p>If anyone asks, this is what happened.</p>
<p>He was a hologram who became sentient. He was turned biological soon after and recognised the error of his ways. He does a good job and everyone likes him.</p>
<p>The incident and the cover up that followed was a major factor in the departure of Dog from the Voyeur, as well as some other revelations.</p>
<p>Vod rose to take over Dog's role as first commander, which he holds until the present day.</p>

<div id="zird_dimension" class="wikiEntry">
    <h2 class="wikiTitle">Zird Dimension</h2>
<p>The Zird Dimension is the dimension of Zird, the extra-dimensional god. Many people have witnessed terrifying things, appearances if angels and gore beasts from another dimension.</p>
<p><a class="wikiLink" href="#the_scab">The Scab</a> is the rotted edge of the 2D world where a 3D cat scratched it, but don't tell them that. They believe it was the Devil herself who made the tear in space and crawled inside, but they'd feel silly saying the texts told of a cat. That enormous cat is still out there in the void of space, confused.</p>
<p>Dimensions in Space Story are <a class="wikiLink" href="#medium">Mediums</a>. Some species have better eyes and insight into the nature of their reality. <a class="wikiLink" href="#seer">Seers</a> can watch reality nonlinearly. They can view inside minds and sneak a peak at the future. <a class="wikiLink" href="#snerson">Sneeple</a> can see outlines. The Zird Dimension is the realm of 3D entities. Some may ascend to the third dimension, most think it's just a myth believed by the 3D'rs.</p>
<h2>Believers of Zird</h2>
<p>Religion based on the belief of higher dimensions. There are many believers. Many claim to have had experiences where they saw a cross section of some kind of entity appear in their 2-Dimensional world. They believe that they're ghosts, demons, or some kind of extra-dimensional creature, if you're an insane person.</p>
<h2>3D'rs</h2>
<p>Entities from the third dimension. They look down on the 2-dimensional world and are confused by it's ability to depict 3D spaces while never utilising a true visual third dimension. It is terrifying. They live in a world with no rational perspective! It is maddening! But every now and then someone will poke the 2D world with a finger and someone in the 2D world has an extra-dimensional experience. Some horrible nearly presented gore flashing in front of them as a physical mass travelling through their dimension.</p>
<p>Scary for everyone, actually.</p>
