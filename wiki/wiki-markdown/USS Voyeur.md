The USS Voyeur is a [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets|Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]] Underdog-class spaceship, under the command of [[Captain]].

The Voyeur isn't an unimportant ship. Underdog class ships are often charged with the more risky jobs, with the kinds of staff you only assign to a job if you don't expect it to pan out anyway, but they don't tell you that. That's for you to realise after a good year of working one of these ships.

The crew of the Voyeur have faced many frustrating little mysteries and challenges under the command of [[Captain|The Captain]]. 

The Voyeur was assigned to the Captain some years ago, and at some point he came to terms with the futility of it.
