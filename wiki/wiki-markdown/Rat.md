The Riddle of Rats are a member species of [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]], [[The Elven Conspiracy]], [[The Consortium]], [[The Cool Planets Club]], and [[The Royal Dominion of Heavenly Bodies]].

The Rats are a welcome species on all planets in the known universe, recognised by some as god-like entities, or as inescapable pests for their cultural omnipresence. 

The cultures of the universe are unsure whether the Rats stand as the greatest example of convergent evolution in the universe, or as its greatest invasive species. Some speculate that they were strategically placed by some ancient spacefaring Rat species billions of years ago. 

Every habitable planet has them in some form, and even some uninhabitable ones have too. On some planets they are the size of a muffin, on others they're the size of mountains. Some of them speak, some of them don't, and all of them squeak.

The rats to have evolved to humanoid form originate from several planets, all having arrived at the same conclusion to their evolutionary chain. 

Whether by coincidence or by ancient design, they are everywhere, and always have been.
