S (pronounced "ess"), is the snake god of the [[Snerson|Sneeple]], and namesake of their homeworld, [[S (Planet)]]

Many thousands of years ago, The Peel, an unravelled planet, reached out across space and latched onto the Snerson homeworld, with many believing it to be the mouth of a galactic snake injecting the venom of wisdom into their planet, thus exhausting it's life force and bestowing it upon their planet. 

They named their planet after this galactic snake, and maintain the name until the present day.

As the Sneeple improved their scientific knowledge, they ventured up the husk of the galactic snake, and discovered the [[Roundoid|Roundoids]] living upon it. 

The Roundoids told them that the snake was in fact a planet that had unravelled after excessive fracking, and had collided with their planet.

The Sneeple, insulted by this idea, believed the Roundoids to be servants of The Orb, the spiritual rival of S. 

Out of spite for the Sneeples' superstition, the Roundoids decided to follow The Orb and engaged in war against the Sneeple. 

The war raged on for so long that the Roindoids came to believe that they were fact were the destined rivals of the Sneeple, followers of their god, The Orb.

With the arrival of the [[Bozo]], the war gradually cooled down, as the Bozo shared their technology and rubbed it in their face that the snake really was just an unravelled planet; a fact long-forgotten by both the Sneeple and the Roundoids.

Both the Sneeple and the Roundoids put aside their war out of embarrassment, and joined the Bozo's newly founded [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets|Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]].

While the conflict had ended, the generational resentment between Sneeple and Roundoids remains.
