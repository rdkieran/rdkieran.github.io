Outlines are a kind of [[Medium]] object. 

They are black, grey, or white lines around objects and bodies that keep their insides from falling out. 

They can also be found encircling text in the form of speech bubbles, and tethering speech bubbles to their source.

The object-level presence of outlines can only been seen by [[Snerson|Sneeple]].
