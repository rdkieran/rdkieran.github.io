The Humiliation of Humans are a member species of [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]] with no official homeworld.

Some hundreds of years ago, they were displaced by nuclear war from their homeworld of [[Earth]], and then partially displaced by more nuclear war from their replacement homeworld of [[Mars]]. 

After the destruction of most Mars colonies, the majority of surviving humans became displaced across various Federation member planets, with few remaining on Mars.

Their love of weapons and lack of scientific ethics makes them somewhat of a pest species, begrudgingly hosted by the member states of GFOCP who refused to give them a third planet to destroy.

[[Uplifted Animals]] are considered to be a sub-species of Human, having been created out of sheer existential loneliness after the humans were initially refused Federation membership (see: [[The Humiliation]]. Humans still continue to create uplifted animals; something the Federation should really address at some point.
