The Humiliation is the period of [[human]] history following on from the destruction of [[Earth]] involving the creation of [[Uplifted Animals]], the destruction of most human colonies on [[Mars]], and ultimately leading to the human race joining [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]].

The human race, following the destruction of Earth by nuclear war, fell into a period of existential loneliness, feeling utterly alone in the universe with no promise of alien life to lift them out of their situation. 

On the edge of extinction living in their flawed and oppressive Mars colonies, the few humans left longed for the comforts of Earth. Green grass, a dog to walk, a petting zoo, all of the funny little creatures now extinct by their catastrophic failure to preserve their planet.

Pulling from their genetic archives, the humans sought to create a kind of alien life for themselves, creating animal/human hybrids to give some colour to their dulling existence.

The GFOCP, surveying the humans' progress, decided to swoop in at this point to have a word with humans about their conduct. 

Overjoyed, the humans set aside their uplifted animal production process and begged for a position in the Federation. A request ultimately refused, so long as the human race continued to be haphazard in its ethical ideals.

What followed from this rejection was further nuclear devastation as the remaining colonies on Mars disagreed on their response to the new Federation. This war destroyed most of what was left of mankind, leaving few colonies left. 

Pitying their quarrelsome nature and recognising their reckless optimism about human nature, the Federation extended their help to the humans to rebuild their remaining colonies, and invite them into their Federation officially, despite their continued production of uplifted animals.

Most of mankind fled toward more populated regions of space, leaving few behind in the upgraded colonies. The GFOCP, recognising their incompetent handling of the event, gave the uplifted animal population their own planetary system of freshly terraformed planets, named the [[The Pity Planets]] system.
