Fabric Space is a mysterious region of space where the laws of the [[Medium]] begin to shift. [[Outlines]] break down and the material quality of reality shifts into threads and fabrics. 

[[Troll|Trolls]] are the only species capable of making the transition from Material Space to Ink Space. Some of the other species of Fabric Space include [[Panthers]], [[Dolls]], and however many others.

The people of Ink Space do their best not to think about this existential question.
