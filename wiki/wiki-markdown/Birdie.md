The Beauty of Birdies are a member species of [[The Galactic Federation of Consenting Planets]] with no known homeworld. They are one of the oldest spacefaring species in the Federation after [[Rat]], rivalling the Bozos in their extensive exploration of space.

Mostly considered pirates and vagabonds, they travel between planets seeking trade or plunder or just a place to rest their feathers after their long migrations through the cosmos.
