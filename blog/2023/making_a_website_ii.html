                <h2>Last time on, Making A Website...</h2>

                <p>Action! <em>Drama!</em> <strong><em>Suspense!!!</em></strong>
                <p>No. Not really. Looking back now, my first pass at the website was okay. Here's how it was.
                <p>I'd foregone the templates and raised my sails to set out on the open seas of opportunity that only a blank folder can offer. I stripped out all the important bits from my original CV website and did my best to stitch it back together, basically rebuilding it but with better file structure.
                <p>What HTML and CSS I had was good enough for something simple and I felt like focusing on that, doing my best to put off the inevitable tangle with JavaScript.
                <p>I wrote my introductory blog, chucked it on the site and pulled up my CSS to started working the styling...
            </div>
            
            <div class="PT1">
                <h2>Part I: Action! Drama! Suspense!!!</h2>

                </figure>

                <p>The upside to starting from scratch is that it makes me feel really clever to remember what DOCTYPE means when I start up some new files. The downside is that I spend hours petting my ego as I rebuild something I've already made before. I gleefully shuffled some files around and neatened up some CSS while I tried not to make eye contact with JavaScript, watching me as I played with dirt and rocks, unwilling to evolve.</p>
                <p>I got the menus and my blog looking as nice as I thought they should. White text with red highlights on an off-black background. My kingdom of mud and rocks.</p>
                <p>But some things kept holding me back:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The headers and footers of every page were hard coded into the HTML, meaning I kept having to copy/paste it to each new file whenever I thought I was done.</li>
                    <li>I was meant to have pages for each of my comics, and there was no way I was going to put up with maintaining over 300 HTML files for every comic page.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As I laboured over these tedious tasks, sweating in the heat of the sun, I wondered if there was a better way to do this, and I chanced a glance at JavaScript. JavaScript was looking back at me. "Scrap your Header and Footer tags and humble yourself before me", it said. And I did.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="INTERM">
                <h2>Intermission</h2>

                <p>How's this so far? Am I giving <em>drama?</em> and <strong><em>suspense???</em></strong></p>
                <p>I've found making this website frustrating, but I don't think I'd have done it any differently if I knew any better. There was this instinct to take the path of least resistance at all times; unwilling to accept that I had to go back to studying.</p>

                <p>On the 11th of August 2022, I started learning Python. I had been playing with formulas in Google Sheets and thought that if there was a chance I could be good at and enjoy coding, then maybe that would be an easier career path than illustration if I could get good at it. Worth a shot at least. And it worked out. I studied a couple hours a week until I got good at it. Well, actually, I studied 11 hours the first week, 9 hours the next 2 weeks, then 6 hours, 2 hours, and 5 hours in the following weeks. Safe to say I enjoy it. I spent long periods of time playing with concepts from each lesson, getting more complex each time, and taking longer each time.</p>
                <p>At some point it began to plateau. I was coding things for no reason, making little scripts that served no purpose but to stroke my ego. "Look at me, I can do a <code>for</code> loop." This was the first time I experienced proper burnout with coding. Expense of effort with nothing to show for it can leave you feeling hollowed out. At this point I decided it was worth looking at other languages.</p>
                <p>So I repeated the process. I did a bunch of lessons in PHP and JavaScript and dabbled in whatever else I could find free courses for. I learned the syntax and did a few scraps of code, and went back to VS Code with a renewed sense of purpose. And when I went to write some JavaScript, I had nothing. I had no command of the language, and the joy I had before with Python wasn't there anymore.</p>
                
                <figure class="articleImage">

                    <figcaption>&mdash; 100 hours of Python, 15 hours of JavaScript. I wonder if that's meaningful.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>I was discouraged. I set out on my goal to build a website using only HTML and CSS, hoping that I wouldn't have to humble myself and admit that I just needed to study JavaScript properly, like I did with Python. Not by reading, but testing things out, playing around. And there I find myself in my first blog, excitedly embarking on my mission to build my website without having to learn anything new. But alas, that's a pain in the ass of a different kind.</p>
                <p>So much of the time it takes following my instincts despite my better judgement, to appreciate the right way of doing things. I don't know why this is my way of learning, but it's probably the same for most people.</p>
                <p>Anyway, the devlog.</p>

            <div class="PT2">
                <h2>Part II: Pass me a cup of that JavaScript!!!</h2>

                <p>And so I sat in the mountain temple of JavaScript, reading its ancient tomes. Documentation from W3Schools and Mozilla and dusty commentaries from the hallowed archives of Stack Overflow (This is a stupid bit).I couldn't help trying to cheat the wisdom of history enshrined in these libraries. As I wandered these halls seeking my answers, the trickster demon ChatGPT followed at my ear, whispering beautiful lies. I could make my website instantly, it said. And when I asked, it pretended not to understand my request.</p>
                <p>I bargained with this demon for a while, until I recognised that, like a genie, the value of your reward matches the quality of your request. I didn't know what the hell I wanted or what to ask for. So I'll put that genie back in the bottle.</p>
                <p>Where was I? Oh yeah. <a href="https://rarebit.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Rarebit</a>. The thing I avoided at the start because it scared me. It was less scary now that I had made peace with the work I had to do.</p>
                
                <figure class="articleImage">
                    <img src="/img/blog/making_a_website_i/rarebit.png">
                    <figcaption>&mdash; I used this picture in the first blog too. economical</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>My route to learning JavaScript was mainly this. I scrapped all my CSS and honed my focus in on how JavaScript and HTML worked together. Rarebit is nicely made, extensively commented, but I felt like I could never trust any changes I made unless I could deconstruct the whole thing. I went ahead and made my headers and footers first, seeing how simple the code for that was.</p>

<pre><code>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.querySelector(".writeHeader").innerHTML = `
    &lt;div class="bannerImage"&gt;
        &lt;a href="/index.html"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/banner/default.png" alt="banner" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;a href="/index.html"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href="/about.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href="/comics.html"&gt;comics&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href="/blog.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    `;
})</code></pre>
<figcaption class="codeCaption">&mdash; <code>comic_header.js</code></figcaption>

                <p>I put them together, puzzled over `defer` and `DOMContentLoaded` and tested it out in my browser. It didn't work. Eventually it did. I pushed it to the main branch on my GitHub and went to my new website. It didn't work. So I went back, changed the location of the file in the HTML from its position on my PC directory to what its position *should* be when uploaded. Whenever I wanted to edit and push something, I did this again. Editing the file reference in each file to test, and then changing it back before it went live.</p>
                <p>My boyfriend noticed this and told me that I can just set up a server for testing on my PC.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="PT3">
                <h2>Part III: Ohhh, okay</h2>

                <figure class="articleImage">

                    <figcaption>&mdash; I got this running with help from <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/notes/simple-http-server-in-python/#:~:text=Python%20comes%20with%20a%20built,system%20into%20a%20web%20server." target="_blank">this HackerHealth article</a></figcaption>

                <p>Until now my discussions with JavaScript were stunted by a lack of understanding. Whenever we spoke, it was fraught with riddles and misunderstandings. By which I mean I didn't know that you could use a built in Python command to make the project folder into a server that you can use to test your websites. Once I discovered this arcane secret, all of JavaScript's riddles unraveled into plain speech. The wrinkles in their face, once concealing their disdain for me, relaxed into an plain, open smile.</p>
                <p>Okay, this makes it much easier. Just change the file, save, and refresh it. Silly narrative aside, this was really helpful. And now that I had some command of JavaScript, the air seemed to clear around me. I looked back at Rarebit's intimidating blocks of code, removed the comments to see it in full, and felt a little less intimidated at the prospect of taking this code and adapting it to a website with multiple comics and a blog section. It didn't seem so bad now.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>First thing, I cleaned out a bit of Rarebit's HTML to use semantic tags rather than a lot of <code><div></code> tags with various classes. The course I took put a really heavy emphasis on accessibility, and now I have an irrational fear of <code><div></code> tags, like they're some kind of dark art with a terrible price. At the very least, using the built in tags made it much easier to write the CSS, using <code>article {</code> instead of <code>div.article {</code> or whatever.</p>
                <p>I won't go through it in detail, but eventually it was plain sailing. I had just enough of a grasp on things that troubleshooting wasn't so stressful, and I inched toward something that worked. Adding in my content and tweaking the site for smaller screens, I felt like that was it. This is basically done.</p>

                <p>Funnily enough, as I look at it now, it wasn't so different from <a href="/img/blog/making_a_website_i/carrd.png" target="_blank">my old Carrd site</a>. Oh well, at least people can look at my comics properly now.</p>

                <p>I made a website.</p>
                <p>It's what I wanted, and now I have it. People can read my comics, and I can play around with web dev stuff with it maybe. Right now it lives on GitHub Pages, but I want to host it somewhere like AWS at some point so that I can play with that for my next project.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, I have a comic to keep making, coding to keep learning, and blogs to keep writing. I need to do some kind of write up for my Audio Sequencer project, which I'll also try to find a silly narrative style for.</p>
