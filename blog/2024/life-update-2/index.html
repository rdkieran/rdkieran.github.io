            <p>Uncomfortable with how my life has been lately. In a kind of free-fall. I feel unable to express anything to anyone, which makes spending time with people unappealing and emotionally tiring.</p>
            <p>Feeling alienated from myself makes it difficult to seek any activity that might make me less lonely. There's no Me to be satisfied by the company. I don't know who I am, so how can I feel seen? </p>
            <p>I've tried committing these thoughts to comic form, but I can't bring myself to be satisfied with anything I draw. I don't have a sense of poetry. I just want to state plainly my futile dissatisfaction, it doesn't feel worth the artistic statement.</p>

            <p>I did a diary comic years ago that I quit because I got too good at coming up with sad things to say, and I'm resistant to doing that again. But lately I'm craving the release.</p>
            <p>After 4 years' forward progress, I'm back where I was in my mid-twenties: in Dundee with not a lot of friends, too bored of myself to inflict my company on others. I got lucky in love last time but that ran out, so now I'm back to being a sad loner with no passions.</p>
            <p>I'm trying to find motivation. I woke up for work this morning and searched my mind for a good reason to get out of bed. If I lost this flat and had to sell all my belongings that wouldn't be so bad, I thought. So I slept in. I'm considering doing the same tomorrow.</p>

            <p>But obviously that's bad. Surely I should do things to ensure some kind of stable future. But I'm unconvinced by anything constructive right now. I don't know what or why I should want.</p>
            <p>My life for the past half a year has been one leap of faith after another, and I'm running out of faith. I haven't felt at home for such a long time. Not a moment of comfort in the company of others, or in myself.</p>
            <p>I think the problem is basic, as it tends to be. I'm trying hard to put on a brave face through all of this, but in truth I'm angry and sad. Denying this is tiring and alienating.</p>

            <p>I don't feel like expressing it in art. I wouldn't know how. My ego looks on my feelings as a test that it is failing. How can I go through this without producing something profound?</p>
            <p>A break up, relocation, redundancy, relocation again, followed by months of relative isolation. All done with the assertion that I'm doing okay, when obviously I'm not. How could I be?</p>
            <p>I'm desperate for things to be good again, but I don't know how they can be. I just want to bury my head in the sand, avoiding all threats to my private misery.</p>

            <p>But hey, whatever. I'll be fine. I'll find a way. I have no choice. It's either that or a slow fade into darkness and obscurity, although that's not entirely out of the question either. I'm sure it happens all the time.</p>
