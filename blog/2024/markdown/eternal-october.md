## Inktober 2022

Inktober. 31 Days, 31 Drawings. I remember it popping up on Tumblr and Instagram in the mid-10s. People flooded their timelines with black and white ink drawings, and their committments waned as the month exhausted. The rare unicorn among them would actually make it to the end, and would be greeted with bewildered applause.

I remember the jokes everyone made about it, a few years after the novelty of it wore off. Everyone got sick of the pressure the art community started to put on itself for everyone to do an art challenge in October of every year. People got sick of ink, people got sick of the random collection of prompts. People set new restrictions, or came up with a good pun and built the challenge around it. Mermay, Doggust, etc. I did Doggust in 2019 and 2020, but I never finished either.

September 2022. Inktober's coming up. At this point people are decidedly ambivalent about it, and if people are planning to do challenges, it's one of a dozen alternatives. I had just finished my third comic (my second _finished_ comic), _Self-Destruct Sequence_, for the [Shortbox Comics Fair](https://www.shortboxcomicsfair.com/). I had finished about 50 pages in two weeks of August, and took a break to think over how I wanted to proceed with _Space Story II_, the sequel to my original comic.

I was having an issue. When I made comics, I just winged it page-to-page. I didn't have the patience to work out the big picture, and found that whenever I wrote anything, I no longer had any interest in drawing it. It was the discovery in the _making_ of the comic that made it so engaging to me as an artform. Plotting and planning out arcs and stories just served to commit me to ideas that I may not be interested in by the time I got there.

I wanted to loosen up a little with a short comic. October was coming up. I thought to myself: What if I did *OC*tober? One original character for each day of the month. No commitment to story or plot, just pure ideas. That would help me get back to the basics, I thought.

## OCtober

October time. Random word generator for prompts, determined to turn every prompt into a curious alien of some kind. But no story, never a story. This isn't a comic.

1. "Thread"
   - Okay, some kind of cheesestring type snake alien. Throw together some lore. Done.
2. "Articulate"
   - Okay, some kind of mechanical arm. Maybe they're friends with the Thread person.

And so on. Of course I fucked it up in the first page. I made the characters know each other, which meant inevitably I had to think about how they met, where they are, what they're doing.

I was having fun of course. Having to come up with a new character for every prompt was so much fun, and relying on narration to push the story was something new for me. I didn't have to painstakingly render every scene and agonise over dialogue.

&mdash; *OCtober*, pg 10

By page 10 I was aleady ignoring my prompts in favour of introducing characters and concepts I was planning in advance, and warping the given prompt to justify it. It seemed funny at the time.

I slowed down. I stopped introducing characters so rapidly, the pages started to fill up with exposition, desperately trying to patch up holes in the narrative to make way for an ending. 

I realised my characters lacked proper voices, and so I started getting into dialogue again.

The late teens of the comic is where I started to lose my mind. I introduced this idea I had of "medium awareness", some kind of enlightened state that some entities can access, but which lesser beings can't handle.

Frayja, my Thread character, starts to see the page.

As I've reflected on the comic over the last year of inaction, this is what I considered my biggest mistake. Looking back today, I realise it was just the cherry on top.

I added myself to it. By name. A very confusing move but, as always, it seemed fun at the time.

I didn't see then that I'd totally fucked up my characters. The comic had become self-aware. I hoped that creating an "author" character could add some kind of meta humour that could allow me to skip the details of building and realising an actual plot.

But I'm not good at sticking to my plans.

Some time passes since I introduced myself to the comic. I return to the comic with a renewed sense of purpose after a hiatus. As soon as I get back, I make another absurd move. I introduce several new versions of an existing character while establishing some magic concepts I'd been mulling over.

And then I dump the comic again for a while.

Of course, I came back to the comic some time later and added even more characters. I'd decided there was no getting out of it now. I decided to make it a comic about having too many characters, and about the burden that places on the plot.

I was ready to kick it into high gear. Make this the stupidest comic ever made. Too many characters, a statement on my over-enthusiasm to make them.

I disappear for a few months and return to the comic. This time, I don't come up with some new scheme, I tell myself. I'm just going to go back to the meta jokes. 

Author Robbie comes back and just tells them what to do and where to go. Point them to the exit so the story can end, that sort of thing. 

That'll get this comic back on track.

I come back in another few months and I make these pages. The Beeple has a dream, and the dream is some silly nonsense.

I hadn't drawn for a while. I was getting rusty. I just wanted to do something fun and quick, so I did this. The Beeple dream is relevant because it allows me to make an individual within the hivemind who might be able to overturn the evil borg hivemind later.

But more importantly, it was an important exercise to rekindle my enthusiasm for the comic again. At last, momentum!

Start of 2024. Half a year since the last page. I zoom out. The author is floating in the white void of a blank page, trying to gather his thoughts.

He's been out here for half a year, thinking as hard as he can. I didn't want to let myself do any new crazy twist. I just wanted to get back to the comic, do whatever it took to make sense of it. 

But it was too far gone. How can I make sense of any of this? Maybe I just needed to escape to some other dimension to get some air.

A couple weeks later. I started therapy in early 2024. I was settled into my job, I had the mental capacity to look back at my comic.

I felt bad for being so hard on myself. With how much had changed in my life in just one year, it's no surprise that this comic dragged out. And I felt bad for what I'd done to it. I was angry at myself for making the thing so complex, tearing it to pieces.

So, Linda.

I'd established a kind of magic self-awareness. Characters can see the author, they can see the page. Seers are established as the reason why Frayja gets to see the future earlier in the story, and at that point I decided they were sacred.

So I brought in a character who can speak to me on my behalf. A character frustrated with the chaotic lack of care I was taking with the plot.

Linda was the best character I added, although I did a bad job of it. I had a beautiful 5 hours creating the tapestry of her abstract realm.

And that visually flexible rule meant that I could change my style rules. Use some pencil textures for a change. Do loose lines.

I really was feeling angry at myself when I drew these pages. I was taking a big shit on the comic, determined to change its fate by calling it on its bullshit.

&mdash; *OCtober*, pg 67

Linda was tasked with the duty of destroying the comic. Tearing me out of it, reducing the comic to nothingness.

And this is where it is now. Me and Linda.

## 555 Days Later
It's a no-hoper of a comic at this point.
