## Inktober 2022

Inktober. 31 Days, 31 Drawings. I remember it popping up on Tumblr and Instagram in the mid-10s. People flooded their timelines with black and white ink drawings, and their committments waned as the month exhausted. The rare unicorn among them would actually make it to the end, and would be greeted with bewildered applause.

I remember the jokes everyone made about it, a few years after the novelty of it wore off. Everyone got sick of the pressure the art community started to put on itself for everyone to do an art challenge in October of every year. People got sick of ink, people got sick of the random collection of prompts. People set new restrictions, or came up with a good pun and built the challenge around it. Mermay, Doggust, etc. I did Doggust in 2019 and 2020, but I never finished either.

September 2022. Inktober's coming up. At this point people are decidedly ambivalent about it, and if people are planning to do challenges, it's one of a dozen alternatives. I had just finished my third comic (my second _finished_ comic), _Self-Destruct Sequence_, for the [Shortbox Comics Fair](https://www.shortboxcomicsfair.com/). I had finished about 50 pages in two weeks of August, and took a break to think over how I wanted to proceed with _Space Story II_, the sequel to my original comic.

I was having an issue. When I made comics, I just winged it page-to-page. I didn't have the patience to work out the big picture, and found that whenever I wrote anything, I no longer had any interest in drawing it. It was the discovery in the _making_ of the comic that made it so engaging to me as an artform. Plotting and planning out arcs and stories just served to commit me to ideas that I may not be interested in by the time I got there.

I wanted to loosen up a little with a short comic. October was coming up. I thought to myself: What if I did *OC*tober? One original character for each day of the month. No commitment to story or plot, just pure ideas. That would help me get back to the basics, I thought.
