            <p>Reminded of lockdown this morning. When lockdown lifted Summer 2020 I about had a breakdown. Back to work in peak paranoia, while everyone I had ready access to online got back to their lives. No more zoom quizzes, no more virtual movie nights. Used to staying at home all the time, my world only got smaller when lockdown ended then.</p>

            <p>Life broadened as I fell in love around that time. By 2021 I'd moved to London from Dundee. I recall a short time there as things went back to normal as lockdown faded to memory. Summer 2024 the love ended, and I'm back in Dundee, Winter 2024.</p>

            <p>I'm living only a few doors up from where I was when I was last here, Summer 2021. By myself this time. I'm reminded of lockdown. Get up, go to work, rest of the time spent trying to make things work alone.</p>
            
            <p>Whenever things get difficult, I draw and make comics to feel better. When I'm doing well, I spend my time on other things. I'm finally getting back to comics after an almost 2-year hiatus.</p>
