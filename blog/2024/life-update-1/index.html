            <p>I fell off for a few years. Got a <span style="font-family:cursive">"Proper Job"</span> that paid like shit and taught me not a lot. Now I have a retail job again that I enjoy that keeps me fit, takes up less time, and doesn't pay significantly less.</p>
            <p>In the last few months, it went like this. June I'm addicted to Skyrim again. Unrelatedly my boyfriend and I break up. My <span style="font-family:cursive">"Proper Job"</span> offers me training in their Australia office, which makes the choice to split up easier. I move home with my parents. Going to Australia in early August, they told me. In September they told me it might be January. I quit the job and move to Dundee instead.</p>
            <p>I spend weeks finding a place, getting a place, furnishing a place. I then spend a few more weeks looking for jobs and trying to get myself together and get optimistic. I listen to Supersad by Suki Waterhouse and thrash my arms around to convince myself. I get a job. I run out of SSRIs for a week and go loopy. In my mania I start making my comic again, and I make my new website.</p>
            <p>That's you caught up.</p>

            <p>Vegyn music videos are very good. This song has been sticking to me for about a year in regular rotation. This is how I wish I danced, and I've been trying to in my new flat. My living room has a lot of space, so I like flailing around in it. Sod dancing actually, flailing is good enough.</p>
