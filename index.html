                <h2>Update: Loose Ends 117 - END</h2>
                <p class="updateDate">Monday the 7th of July, 2025</p>
                <p>That's it! Enough! The comic is over. Maybe one day I'll address the implications of this abrupt and graceless ending, but not today. I must move on. I hope it was enjoyable.</p>

            <img src="/img/announcements/always-has-been.png" alt="illustration of two characters from Loose Ends - Lanky and Scottie. they are expressing the absurdity of their created universe. don't worry, it doesn't make sense to me, either.">

            <p>I've got the fever for my comic again, and I want to make this website more usable. No dark mode? No pinch to zoom? What kind of joke is this? I will try to remember CSS so I can fix it.</p>
