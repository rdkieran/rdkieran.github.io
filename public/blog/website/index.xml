      <description>Last time on, Making A Website&amp;hellip; Action! Drama! SUSPENSE!!! No. Not really. Looking back now, my first pass at the website was okay. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it was. I&amp;rsquo;d foregone the templates and raised my sails and set out on the open seas of opportunity that only a blank folder can offer. I stripped out all the important bits from my original CV website and did my best to stitch it back together, basically rebuilding it but with better file structure.</description>

      <description>I want a new website I&amp;rsquo;ve had a website once before, on Carrd. The whole thing was one page which gave the illusion of multiple pages by hiding content behind section break dividers. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to code anything when I made this, and it did the trick for having a handy place to show off my portfolio. But I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted a proper website, one which hosts a blog and my comics in an interactive way.</description>
